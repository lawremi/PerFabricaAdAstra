#+TITLE: Per Fabrica ad Astra: Through craft, to the stars
* Goal
  Add more realistic and educational aspects to the Minecraft
  experience. We want to teach science (geology, physics, chemistry,
  biology, ...), math, statistics and engineering (algorithms).

* Premise
** Extraction and Chemistry
   The basic idea is to add many realistic raw materials to the world
   and then allow the player to mine them and perform chemistry with
   them to make useful things, including with machines and items from
   other mods.
   
** Star travel
   A relatively advanced player will be capable of building a
   spaceship, in order to seek out resources on other planets. All
   items must be discarded prior to launch, due to weight
   limitations. The player first must colonize the moon. Colonization
   would initially involve programming of robots to perform most
   tasks. A progressively larger network/system of domes would be
   constructed, with a livable atmosphere. Eventually, an
   interplanetary ship would be constructed in low gravity. Then there
   is a choice to go towards the sun (Venus, then Mercury) or away
   (towards Mars). Once on Mars (or Venus) the player must colonize and
   harvest enough food to make the next jump. From Mars, the player
   travels to Ganymede (or back to Earth). From Ganymede, the player must
   build a smaller ship to visit other moons of Jupiter. Or refuel the
   interplanetary ship and fly to Titan. The player may visit other
   notable moons of Saturn. Eventually, the player has colonized all
   planets and notable moons and obtained a resource unique to each. By
   combining those resources, the player may build an interstellar ship
   and begins traveling to known exoplanets or psuedo-randomly
   generated moons. We might also require the user to construct special
   sensor stations on every planet in order to triangulate the position
   of the exoplanet. As an alternative to travel, the player may decide
   to settle down and terraform.
* Concepts
** Science
*** Physics
    Most of the physics concepts will enter through chemistry. Some of
    the key concepts would be:
    * Mechanics
    * Thermodynamics
    * Light
    * Electricity and magnetism
    Overall, these concepts seem too low-level to easily introduce
    directly.

*** Chemistry
    This seems like the right level, and is most directly applicable
    when it comes to mining and crafting things from mined
    material. This would extend from inorganic to organic chemistry,
    and even on to some simple biochemistry.
    
**** Reactions
     Mined materials will be modeled as chemical compounds, and those
     can then be converted into other compounds using reaction chambers.
     Initially, technology will only allow the simplest of chambers,
     such as cauldrons and stills. Eventually, there are BuildCraft
     machines. Different chambers will carry out different types of
     reactions. Reaction rates will depend on the free energy. This of
     course depends on the temperature and pressure.

**** Knowledge
     How to model chemical knowledge? How does the player "learn" that
     a particuar reaction is possible? The periodic table represents
     the fundamental knowledge of chemistry, and it is also discrete,
     so conveniently breaks down into units of achievement. For every
     mineral or other compound, the player performs a number of simple
     assays and eventually discovers an element. Once all elements in
     a particular compound are known, the chemical formula and other
     information (depending on the general level of
     technology/knowledge) are revealed. This information includes
     some subset of the recipes including that compound, as long as
     the technology exists to achieve the recipe, and all compounds in
     the reaction are known.

     Elements are discovered by solving a puzzle that is roughly
     inspired by how the element was discovered according to
     history. The book of the elements will convey hints.

     The Book of Elements slowly reveals those secrets. It is created
     by sending a book into a 1x1 portal and having it reappear as the
     Book of Elements. This is to simulate a trip to the future.
     
*** Biology
    High-level biological concepts like plant growth, ecology, etc,
    are already modeled in the game. Perhaps those models could be
    improved. The low-level concepts like molecular biology would be
    too complex to model outside of simple e.g. bacterial
    systems. Genetics is a real possibility. The bees and
    tree-breeding of Forestry are a good example.
    
** Engineering
   Most of Minecraft could be construed as civil engineering. Some
   disciplines that might need more attention:

*** Mechanical
    Would require much better physical modeling. This would be tough.

*** Aerospace
    Like mechnical, requires more physical modeling.

*** Chemical
    This comes about naturally by constructing the machines necessary
    to carry out chemistry (see that section).

*** Electrical
    Already exists to some extent with red stone cicuits. Good enough.

*** Computer Science
    The key direction would be robotics. ComputerCraft already offers
    that, and we should integrate with it.

** Economics/trade
   Production is motivated by the economy, and trade would enhance
   gameplay by encouraging specialization, investment in
   transportation, etc. To drive tade, we need a non-uniform
   distribution of resources. This means that minerals should be
   concentrated in large but infrequent deposits and limited to
   particular biomes. Crops should be biome-specific. Geologica has
   achieved this for minerals, but it is still possible to farm crops
   in any biome. But the villages could be constrained to only
   produce the appropriate crops (like Millenaire).
    
** History
   In terms of the history of the Earth, Minecraft is situated
   somewhere in the agricultural age, with some industrial
   aspects. The technical mods place the game firmly in the industrial
   age. The Millenaire mod brings real world cultures to Minecraft,
   although these are limited to those of the Middle Ages. We could
   extend Millenaire to model the industrial age. We could also target
   pre-human time periods, such as the age of the dinosaurs. This
   would mostly require a mod in the vein of ExtraBiomes and Mo'
   Creatures that presents prehistoric flora and fauna. That would be
   fun, but the artwork would be challenging. The wildlife would be
   located in separate dimensions, perhaps accessible through
   Mystcraft.

   In the next sections, we have started outlining the main
   periods of history. It is not clear whether this will generate
   interesting gameplay; what would the different plants and animals
   offer compared to the existing game? Perhaps we should focus on
   recent (human) history and work our way backwards.

*** Mesozoic: Age of Reptiles
**** Triassic
     Hot and dry, with no ice, jungle or swamp biomes. Instead, more
     deserts, plains and temperate forests.
     
**** Jurassic
**** Cretaceous
     
*** Cenozoic: Age of Mammals
**** Paleocene
    
**** Eocene

**** Oligocene

**** Miocene

**** Pliocene

*** Modern Era
**** Modern Age (1900-now)
**** Age of Empires (1500-1900)
**** Middle Ages (600-1500)
     This is the setting of base Millenaire. Important cultures
     missed by Millenaire:
     * Pueblos
     * Mississippians
     * Arabs
     * Chinese (Song)
     * Korean
       
**** Classical Age (700 BC - 600 AD)
     Like the roman empire...
     
** Agriculture and Forestry 
   We could add some aspects to agriculture:

*** Aquaculture
    * Kelp

*** Feces
    Cows and pigs and other animals could be made to poop. Uses of poop:
    * Fertilizer
    * Fuel
    * Tanning (dog or pigeon)
    * Cement for adobe bricks

*** Genetics ideas
    There is a need to genetically engineer crops. This is way more
    realistic and relevant than bee and tree breeding.

    Here is a phylogenetic resource:
    http://botanistinthekitchen.wordpress.com/the-plant-food-tree-of-life/phylogenetic-tree-view/

    List of crops:
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_domesticated_plants

    Wild relatives (where to find them):
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crop_wild_relative
    http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Center_of_origin
    
    The main idea is to follow a phylogenetic tree. The
    player obtains some basic crops (maybe the vanilla ones, or foods
    found in the wild) in the world.

    We could adopt the Forestry mechanism entirely. It is reasonably
    derived from Mendelian inheritance. Hybrids between related
    species will represent the common ancestor, and mutations can form
    to one of the other descendents. The less related the two species,
    the less likely for them to breed.

    This design requires that we have the wild forms of the crops
    (which in the real world are highly localized).

**** Old sequence alignment ideas
    Somehow the player analyzes the genome of two crops and then
    enters a mini-game dimension which involves aligning two
    sequences, where the bases are blocks. An alignment tool (with
    durability) held by the player shifts blocks around. Obviously,
    the more closely related the species, the easier it is to align
    them. Depending on the quality of the alignment, the common
    ancestor is more or less well known. The better known, the more
    options for evolving that ancestor to other species, and the
    easier it is to find its ancestor. Species might evolve in two
    ways: cross-breeding and mutations. Cross-breeding is something
    like Forestry. Mutation is a mini-game dimension where the goal
    is to change a DNA sequence to a target protein. One block per
    amino acid, with the target sequence on top of the source. Each
    block would be visually partitioned into the three bases. The
    player uses a mutagenesis tool (light, chemical, etc) to convert
    the bases. Each mutation costs some amount of resources, either
    through direct consumption or tool durability. Transitions should
    be cheaper than transversions. One has to figure out the cheapest
    path, given the genetic code.

*** Wild edible plants
    Generating realistic, edible, non-crop plants, is also
    interesting: it introduces unconventional (at least for this part
    of the world) foods and makes the world richer. Call it
    ForageCraft or WildCraft.

    The wild plants are not cultivatable. Trees do not yield
    saplings, plants do not yield seeds, but they can be replanted
    directly. Breeding is the only means of reproduction and can lead
    to cultivation, through mutation. The breeding needs to integrate
    with existing tree breeding in Forestry and Extra Trees. The
    mutation (speciation) probabilities depend on phylogenetic tree. 

    Mod integration: if a mod like ET is loaded, we should use the
    blocks from that mod. We *could* require certain mods, but it
    would be nice to be functional independently. Obviously, breeding
    will depend on Forestry.

   Here is a list of what might be found in the wild:

   Currently about 80 plants. Proposals for simplification:
   * Have one palm tree (+coconut); BOP already has them
   * Have one type of wild herb (mint?), instead of all herbs.
   
   PHC now has all of its plants occuring in the wild as
   "garden blocks". This would be an alternative to generating so many
   types of plants in the world. But Plant Megapack has already shown
   that it can be fun.
   
*** Forestry
    Wikipedia has some nice references:
    * Wood products: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wood#Uses (see
      categories at bottom of page)
    * Non-wood forest products: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-timber_forest_product
    
*** Biofuels

*** Fibers 
    
*** Balanced diet
    If we have lots of plants, then we have lots of food. To make
    things more interesting, we should encourage balanced diets. Use
    something like the food pyramid.
    
    * Grains: 25%
    * Vegetables: 25%
    * Fruits: 20% 
    * Protein: 15%
    * Dairy: 15%
    * Sweets: temporary buff, long term detriment
    
    Balanced diets give buffs, imbalanced have negative effects.
    
*** Adapting existing mods
    PHC provides many interesting crops, and Forestry brings fun
    automation and breeding.

    Improvements that should happen for PHC:
    * PHC juices should be Forge fluids
    * PHC needs to be integrated with Forestry farms and machines
      See: https://github.com/ForestryMC/ForestryMC/issues/223
      * Farms
      * Squeezer
      * Fermenter
      * Breeding mechanism [done by Agricraft]
    * PHC crops should have biome-specific growth rates (hunger overhaul)
    * PHC should use machines for cooking [easy via KawaiiCrops]
    * PHC drinks should require a glass bottle

    Turns out someone has integrated PHC with Forestry-like breeding
    mechanics, and it is totally customizable: Agricraft. In theory,
    we could have Plant Mega Pack plants mutate to PHC crops.
    
* Blocks
** Rocks
   Generating terrain with multiple rock types, instead of simply
   stone, would make mining much more interesting. Not only would it
   add variety (and thus more creativity in construction), it would
   also help the player find ores, since ores would be specific to
   certain rock types. This idea is from TFC, but it also reflects
   the reality. COG might allow us to generate the rocks, in addition
   to the ores. It looks like the substitution pattern would work,
   but it would need a height restriction. Also, we would need
   restrictions on relative height (percentage of altitude).

   There are three types of rock: igneous, sedimentary and
   metamorphic. The igneous rocks are either intrusive (magma) and
   extrusive (lava). A second axis is the silicate content, which
   decreases with felsic, intermediate, mafic and
   ultramafic. Sedimentary rocks are either clastic or
   (bio)chemical. The metamorphic rocks can be formed by a number of
   different processes: hydrothermal, contact, barrovian,
   blueschist, and eclogite. The last two are probably too deep for
   us to care about. Unless otherwise indicated, rocks are
   generated as layers. So far, we have 21 rock types. It would be
   good to reduce this to 16, just for simplicity. We will need two
   block IDs anyway, in order to model soft vs. hard rock.

   We could drop pegmatite and serpentinite, because they are already
   so enriched for minerals. Tough call. They do serve a purpose:
   indicating that ores are nearby.

   Placement of the rocks during world generation will be
   complex. Lets focus first on the bottom layer, which will consist
   of rock formed by cooling magma, i.e., igneous intrusive
   rock. These intrusions form dikes as the magma rises, and sills
   where the magma is deposited. The differentiation occurs by two
   major processes: fractional crystallization (multiple layers
   crystallizing from molten rock) and partial melting (where only
   some of the minerals melt, rise due to lower density, and
   recrystallize). This follows the order of ultra-mafic, mafic,
   intermediate, felsic, from bottom to top. We consider only
   partial melting, for simplicity.

   When the magma breaches the surface, we then have extrusive rocks
   with different crystallization (much more rapid cooling) but the
   same chemical compositions. The type of rock that emerges depends
   on how much the rock has cooled, and whether water is present.
   
   Land masses are formed by plate convergence, which occurs at the
   interface of land and ocean. The oceans then are undergoing plate
   divergence. Under the ocean, ultra mafic rocks (peridotite)
   partially melt and rise quickly due to the divergence, and hit the
   ocean as mafic melts, forming basalt. The melts that fail to reach
   the surface form the intrusive mafic gabbro. In the case of plate
   convergence, mountains and volcanoes are formed. Since water from
   the ocean is brought down into the subduction zone, the melting
   points of the rocks are lowered and thus more silicate-rich melts
   (intermediate and felsic) emerge from partial melting. So volcanic
   islands in the ocean are largely basaltic, while the volcanoes
   above subduction zones yield rocks like rhyolite and (from mixing
   of the rhyolitic and mafic magma) andesite. The more water, the
   more silicate content, and the more violent the eruption.

   With that in mind, the oceans are clear: peridotite (too low to
   include), gabbro, basalt and sediments (mudrock).  The vast
   majority of the land mass is formed from silicate-rich magma that
   cools before it reaches the surface. This is largely
   granite. Above subduction zones, granite is pushed up into
   mountains, above some diorite, then gabbro.  In areas outside of
   the mountains and oceans, the world will only reach down into
   diorite. We ignore komatiite, because its intrusions happened long
   ago and has largely metamorphed. We will assume that the extreme
   hills are a volcanic mountain range, and the ice mountains are
   a result of sedimentary and metamorphic rock being uplifted
   (crumpled) by subduction forces.

   The generation of the rock layers depends on the biome. The table
   below attempts to specify the rock combinations for each
   biome. For simplicity, we group all types of mudrock (claystone,
   conglomerate, etc) into a single rock. Metamorphic rocks will be
   listed separately, as their formation will be randomized and
   replace specific rocks.
   
   The layers are numbered from top (1) to bottom. The final layer
   should be about half the size of the others.

*** Generation
    In the table we list sedimentary as a general class including
    mudstone, claystone, siltstone, sandstone and limestone. A layer
    of mudrock will typically consist of a mixture of layers from
    these rocks. Claystone and siltstone are two ends of the mudstone
    spectrum. There is currently no "silt" in the game, and it would
    probably not add much, so we might have siltstone just drop dirt,
    or just get rid of it altogether. Then we have claystone=>clay,
    and conglomerate/breccia=>gravel when harvested. Clay is
    somewhat of a limiting resource in minecraft, so we should limit
    claystone distribution. The beach and desert will be largely
    sandstone. The ocean bottom will be limestone, and limestone could
    also dominate hill biomes. Outside of the hills, lets say 65%
    mudstone, 10% sandstone, 10% conglomerate/breccia, 10% limestone,
    and 5% claystone.

    Breccia should replace much of the gravel at depth.

    What about mudstone? It consists of a mixture of silt and
    clay. It could drop a mixture of clay and sand, or should that
    require further processing?
    
    Now for metamorphosis.
    
    Mudrock will convert to slate, and slate, along with igneous
    rocks, can follow the sequence to schist and gneiss. This is most
    likely to happen in the ice mountain biome, and to a lesser extent
    the hill biomes, since more pressure will be put on the
    rock. Slate replaces the top half of the sedimentary layer, schist
    replaces the top third of the igneous (granite) layer, and gneiss
    replaces the next third down. Rocks can exist without rocks
    earlier in the sequence, but having an earlier rock doubles the
    chance of having a later one.
    
    With regard to contact metamorphism, hornfel and marble will
    sometimes replace the mudstone between the limestone hills and the
    underlying granite. The sandstone under the desert hills will
    sometimes become quartzite.
    
    Serpentinite will occur anywhere an ultra-mafic intrusion might
    have occurred. We will say that this is in the bottom (diorite)
    layer, except maybe in the extreme hills and ocean, where
    serpentinite is common throughout the crust. If it contacts soil,
    the soil needs to be converted to lateritic soil, which does not
    support growth. Pegmatites occur in granite and gneiss. Both of
    these will be large, thick veins that contain many ores.
    
*** Grinding
    Perhaps claystone, conglomerate,
    mudstone, etc all yield a type of "debris" that could be
    processed? The debris would be similar to gravel, but distinct
    from it. Or it could be a type of gravel, but then what of the
    existing gravel? Either way, the debris would act much like
    gravel/sand. Maybe just coarser than gravel. Then, we have the
    following grinding recipes (for the broken/loose form):
    * Andesite: sand + (10%) feldspar
    * Breccia: 2 gravel
    * Carbonatite: sand + (20%) CaO
    * Conglomerate: sand + gravel
    * Claystone: 2 clay dust, each hydrates to 4 clays
    * Diorite: sand + (10%) feldspar
    * Gabbro: sand + (20%) feldspar

*** Stone variants
    How do we handle variants of stone? These include:
    * Moss stone (moss form of cobblestone)
    * Mossy stone brick
    * Chiseled stone brick
    * Cracked stone brick
    
    Till now, we have considered these as special items found in the
    world (strongholds, temples, etc). Not as building materials. But
    what happens when:
    * Forestry moisterizer generates mossy stone/brick
    * Gregtech hammer cracks stone brick
    * Gregtech file chisels stone brick
      
    For now, it seems we could add recipes targeting the vanilla
    variants. Adding custom chiseled or mossy stone would probably
    not be very attractive in general. And craked stone brick? In
    general, these seem to have limited utility.

   In terms of gameplay, there is a limit to the number of ores. The
   player might constantly encounter ores and have difficulty sorting
   them. Solutions would include having ores occur rarely, or
   deriving metals as the by-product of processing other ores. Both
   support technology tiers, as advanced machines could be required
   to process the more advanced metals. Currently, that is modeled by
   the type of pickaxe. The first has the advantage of making
   discovery more challenging, while the processing approach could
   encourage automation, because large amounts of ore will need to be
   processed. It also requires the player to make a decision about
   how an ore should be processed. Thus, it adds strategy. Ore
   discovery could also be made more stategic by making deposits
   depend on the rock type or having deposits co-occur (better dig
   into that iron because it might have manganese). Some mixture of
   the two is probably best, and certain metals could be obtained by
   both approaches.
   
   By changing the ore distributions to such an extent, gameplay is
   greatly affected. For example, a quarry might only gather one or
   two types of ore. Perhaps all generation could occur in a Mystcraft
   age. There could be a symbol for each type of ore, and one for
   adding the new rocks. Modifiers would also be supported, but they
   would add instability. Obtaining each symbol would involve some
   challenge. Many could be found in mineshaft chests, temples or
   villages (possibly specific villages from Millenaire?). Need to
   wait for COG to support the new Mystcraft API.
   
   TE has the induction smelter which allows for complex smelting (two
   inputs, and a primary/secondary output), and EIO has something
   similar. The Foundry mod will likely have interesting options.

   Getting balance from production levels is complicated. The ore
   production levels are confounded with the purity of the ore, while
   the metal production may represent only a minor application of the
   ore. We are interested in *potential* metal production and want to
   assume that each ore block contains the same amount of metal,
   across all metal elements. Another assumption: each ore block is
   the same weight; i.e., they have different densities. We then
   normalize everything to iron for convenience.

** Sands
   Here are some sand types we could model:
    
   | Type         | Occurrence    | Use                        |
   |--------------+---------------+----------------------------|
   | Mineral sand | beach/river   | placer deposit (see above) |
   | Garnet       | beach         | abrasive                   |
   | Volcanic ash | extreme hills | abrasive                   |
   | Quartz       | desert        | abrasive, quartz           |
   | Cassiterite  | beach/river   | tin                        |


   Currently, we have different types of mineral sands. These need to
   be separated into minerals like rutile, zircon, magnetite,
   etc. This is usually done with electrostatic separation. About 70%
   of the sand is "trash". For granitic sands, this means quartz (50%)
   magnetite (35%), kyanite (15%); for basaltic: garnet (40%),
   magnetite (35%), chromite (15%) and quartz (10%). The more valuable
   minerals in the remaining 30% are: ilmenite (50%), zircon (30%),
   rutile (15%), monazite (5%). Total mineral sand production is 4.8
   million tonnes / yr, or about 6:1 with Fe. Basaltic sands will have
   more ilmenite, while granitic will have less (and thus more zircon,
   rutile and monazite). Maybe ilmenite (30%), zircon (40%), rutile
   (20%), monazite (10%).

   Summary:
   
   * Granitic :: 35% quartz, 25% magnetite, 5% kyanite, 10% zircon,
                 15% rutile, 5% ilmenite, 5% monazite
   * Basaltic :: 10% quartz, 35% garnet, 25% magnetite, 5% chromite,
                 15% ilmenite, 5% zircon, 5% rutile

** Hot springs
   Some percentage of the water source blocks near bedrock will be
   converted to hot springs, which are infinite steam
   sources. Buildcraft (or some other mod) has apparently already
   added springs (infinitely pumpable water sources); just need hot ones.

** Brines
   Brines are a source of many minerals. We could add these as
   liquid source blocks in sets that form little lakes/wells. The
   wasteland water could be considered brine.

   Types:
   * Owens Lake :: Borax, NaCl, Na2SO4
   * Midland :: Br, CaCl2, I, MgCl2, KCl, NaCl
   * Searles Lake :: Borax, LiCl, Li2CO3, Mg(OH)2, KCl, NaBr,
                     Na2CO3, NaCl, NaF, Na2PO4, Na2SO4
   * Silver Peak :: Li2CO3, KCl
   
   Do we really want these four, somewhat arbitrary, types? Probably
   not. Just take the union. Chemical processing will separate.

   List of chemicals/minerals:
   * Borax
   * *NaCl* (halite)
   * NaBr
   * NaF
   * Na2CO3 (soda ash)
   * Na2SO4 (salt cake, mirabilite when hydrous)
   * Na3PO4
   * *LiCl*
   * Li2CO3 (also from spodumene)
   * *KCl* (sylvite)
   * *MgCl2*
   * Mg(OH)2
   * CaCl2
   * *Bromine*
   * *Iodine*
     
   Only the ones in *bold* are commericially extracted.
   
** Sea water
   There are many minerals in sea water. But how to model those? We
   cannot replace the blocks, because that would break other mods. One
   could attempt to trace pipes back to the sea, but it would be
   brittle. Imagine an aqueous accumulator that is accumulating sea
   water; no other machines, like the liquid transposer, know that it
   is brine. There is a liquids API in forge now, so in theory things
   could be abstracted, but there is no way to create a new "subclass"
   of water. It is either water or brine. So maybe we just need to
   create brine wells/springs. Otherwise, the processing would need to
   be very slow, because water is so plentiful. Ensure that source
   blocks are not transportable by bucket. Or just use the water
   sources in the ExtraBiomes wasteland. Here is an idea: require that
   the initial processing (could be some filter or something) must
   occur in the ocean biome. This more or less achieves the desired
   effect.

** Machines
   There are three tiers of crafting complexity: manual, single-block
   machines and multi-block machines. Single block machines are
   cheap, compact but limited in terms of features and performance
   compared to the multi-block machines. These are mostly inspired by
   the notes in the Chemical Processing section.

*** Single-block
**** Solid-fluid Mixer
     Mixes a solid and a fluid (stored in a liquid buffer). Has a
     temperature gauge and accepts steam input for heating. The mixing
     energy is provided by redstone. One liquid output, with
     buffer. Pressurized version permits boiling point elevation.
     
**** Fluid-fluid Mixer

*** Multi-block
    
** Concrete
   Minecraft needs concrete. One of the cool things about concrete
   is that one can pour it into molds and generate many objects of the
   same shape. The player could construct a shape out of microblocks,
   hook it up to a pipe (via some adjacent machine) and pump concrete
   into it. The machine will then, after some time, yield an item of
   the desired shape, consuming some amount of concrete.
** Crystals
   For the ore textures, we should indicate the mineral by its crystal
   habit, color, luster, and cleavage. Perhaps we can have a canonical
   crystal rendered in high resolution, and that is sampled multiple
   times to draw a number of crystals as an overlay on the rock. Since
   these are simple triangles, we could even consider direct
   rendering, which actually might be faster than drawing multiple
   textures. We will sketch up prototypes first, of course.

   Vitreous should be semi-transparent (like stained glass), while
   resinous should be much more translucent.

   Tabular cleavage can have a sloping edge on one side, like BDcraft
   lapis lazuli.

   Other textures to fix:
   * Pegmatite should be a mixture of various crystals.
   * Banded iron should be redone as overlay
      
* Items
** Chemicals
*** Properties
    We could model chemicals at a number of different levels of
    detail. For example, we could record every property, or simply
    consider the name. Optimal is somewhere in between.

    Some obvious properties:
    * Formula (name would be in translations)
    * Color (black, blue, green, ...)
    * Phase at room temperature (and standard pressure)
    * Hazards: health (0-4), flammability (0-4), reactivity (0-4),
      special (reacts with water, asphyxiant, oxidizer)
    
    One could imagine adding more properties that might lead to
    automatic recipe generation, but this is not worth it.

    Somehow, I refuse to take the above advice. The elegance of
    algorithmic recipe generation based on fundamental properties is
    somehow irresistible to me!

    Things we want to automate:
    * Phase transitions: have machines that melt and freeze
      substances, as well as heat exchangers that e.g. use steam/water
      transition to add/substract heat to reactors, boilers, etc.
      Requires: critical temperatures, heat capacity integrated from
      standard temperature to critical temperature, enthalpy of
      fusion/vaporization (calculated from dS), need Antoine
      coefficients to compute boiling temperature by pressure, in
      theory we could also figure out the dHf for the non-standard
      states using the standard Hf and the heat capacity information.
    * Enthalpy of reactions: whether a reactor will need cooling,
      heating, etc. Requires: enthalpy of formation, sometimes
      enthalpy of solution? Enthalpy of formation could be calculated
      from the elements if we had the formation reactions, but those
      are not useful otherwise,
    * Free energy of reaction: whether a reaction can proceed at a
      given temperature, important for smelting. Requires: enthalpy of
      formation, entropy.
    * Solubility: for mixing, what dissolves in water? This relates
      to the dynamic equilibrium, i.e., kinetics, so we might need
      the direct solubility value, but maybe only a rough one, like
      insoluble, sparingly soluble, soluble. And maybe solubility
      will be according to the temperature of the liquid, which we
      roughly define as cold, standard, hot.
    * Density: for gravity-based separation, known for gasses
      (assuming ideal) if we know the molar mass,
    * Default oxidation state: for predicting oxide from thermal
      decomposition of metal carbonates, sulfates, nitrates, etc.
      
    Summary of information needed for solid/liquid/gas/aqueous?:
    * Critical temperatures (relatively easy to find),
    * Shomate (or other function) parameters for heat capacity (tough
      to find, NIST), or perhaps an average value when not available,
      note that Shomate parameters additionally provide the entropy
      and (through some solving) the critical temperatures,
    * Antoine coefficients (tough to find, NIST),
    * Enthalpy of formation (not easy),
    * Standard molar entropy (not easy),
    * Rough solubility in different solvents (cold/standard/hot) (easy),
    * Density (easy),
    * Viscosity (easy for typical liquids, molten we assume lava-like),
    * Magnetic susceptibility (probably on an adhoc basis),
    * Atomic weight (elements only, easy),
    * Default oxidation state (elements only, easy),
    * Color (easy),
    * Hazard (easy)
    
    The problem is that many of these properties are
    unknown/unpublished, even for well-known chemicals. If the
    enthalpy of formation and/or standard molar entropy are missing,
    then we depend on the temperature/energy being specified at the
    reaction level, or there are simply no reactions (for that
    phase). Calculating the phase change enthalpies becomes more
    problematic though. We could always simply not support conversion
    of the material to that phase, but that seems restrictive.

    Assume we only have solid-phase properties. We could, with some
    effort, get the heat of fusion from the solubility, and from that
    derive the entropy, and the enthalpy (at that temperature). In
    fact, we could even assume that the lines in the ellingham diagram
    are linear, despite phase changes (only gas makes a big
    difference). But even with that, we do not know the heat capacity
    of the liquid, so how to heat it?

    The basic problem is that we are designing an extension to a
    sandbox game and yet there is a point at which the player will
    move beyond what is well understood by Science (mostly due to a
    lack of interest). At that point, we need to either *restrict* or
    *extrapolate*.

    For example, these guys extrapolate the thermodynamics of NiO
    https://www.msm.cam.ac.uk/teaching/partIB/courseC/BH.pdf.
    They guess the entropy (which would give us the enthalpy of
    fusion) and enthalpy of formation.

    An approach to estimating the enthalpies of fusion from solubility:
    http://www.umsl.edu/~chickosj/JSCPUBS/mottpce.pdf
    Might only apply to organics, but who cares?

    Extrapolation would probably take too much work and would require
    intuition that we are lacking. It is much better to restrict than
    to introduce poorly defined chemicals. But what happens when a
    substance is heated -- we should not allow it to be heated
    infinitely (obviously the machine has some limit, but that may be
    far in excess of the critical point). Easiest option is to simply
    cease the heating and alert the user that the melting point has
    been reached, but that would be lame in a machine that is supposed
    to yield a molten product. But really, do we care about accurately
    modeling the transition to something that is essentially useless?
    
    A bigger problem is the heat capacity: it has a complex
    dependency on temperature; i.e., there is no single
    value. Without that, it really does not matter whether we know
    the heats of phase transitions. We have to rely on the Shomate
    Equation, from the NIST webbook. Should we pre-integrate the
    Shomate equation to the transition point? This seems too
    limited. For example, we need to know how to heat substances to
    arbitrary temperatures, for thermal decomposition, arbitrary
    reactions, etc. If we knew the full parameter set, we could
    directly simulate the thermodynamic system. Unfortunately, most
    chemicals/phases do not have a set of Shomate parameters.

    One possibility is using simpler forms of the equation. We have
    resources with Cp values for a range of temperatures, as well as
    standard enthalpies of formation and molar entropies. That might
    work, for the standard phase, at least.

**** Alloy Steel
     Properties of steel alloys:
     * Machinability: MnS, Bi, Pb, Se, Te
     * Corrosion resistance: Cr, Cu, Ni
     * Toughness: B, Cr, Mn, Mo, Ni, Cu, Si, V, W, Ti, Nb
     * Temperature tolerance: W, V
     
     Other alloyants: Al, Co, Ce, Sn, Zn, Zr
     
     We could model steel alloys by allowing up to 3 non-iron ingots
     to be included in the smelting. Those non-iron ingots could be
     all of the same material, or different materials.
     In addition, there could be "super alloys".

     How to model the different properties? One easy way is higher
     yield recipes, or recipes that require less of one alloy
     vs. another. But what about differentiating the properties?

     Types of steel alloys:
     
     | Alloyants   | Properties                              | Use                                    |

     | 2Si+1Mn     | more toughened                          | springs, punches, chisels              |

     Stainless steel (Cr, Ni, C, Mn, Si, P, S, N):

*** Hazards
    There are many fun possibilities when it comes to hazards. These
    rely on some model for chemical spills. Does this happen when a
    pipe or machine breaks (presumably due to some initial hazard?).
    
**** Health
     Damages player without other environmental effects.
     * Level >1, starts to hurt if ingested (increasing damage with level).
     * Level >2, hurts if held in inventory (open container) or touched
     * Level 3: damage similar to cave spider poison
     * Level 4: like burning in lava (must drink milk to stop)
     
     New idea: it seems that gases should apply effects when at eye
     level (inhaled) and liquids when contacted in the
     world. Ingestion of liquids should magnify effects.

     Fluid contact:
     * Level >=2: Poison effect
     * Level >=3: Increased poison effect
     * Level >=4: Increased poison effect, usually lethal
     
     Fluid ingestion (drinking a potion):
     * Level >=1: Nausea
     * Level >=2: Nausea + poison effect
     * Level >=3: Nausea + increased poison effect  
     * Level >=4: Nausea + increased poison effect, usually lethal
     
     Some liquids may have additional effects. They may also need
     custom countermeasures. For now, level >= 3 treated by milk.

     If the boiling point is near room temperature, contact with
     liquid is equivalent to contact with the gas. Or we need to model
     liquids spawning gases, which would be cool.
     
**** Flammability
     Will ignite when in contact with a flame/spark, depending on
     temperature. Temperatures for each level:
     * Level 1: > 200 C
     * Level 2: > 100 C
     * Level 3: > 23 C, flammable outside of ice biomes
     * Level 4: < 23 C, always flammable
     
     At ordinary temperature, the difference between L3 and L4 is a
     matter of degree. If player catches on fire with flammable items
     in inventory, the items will burn up, damaging the player. For
     L3 and L4, using flint and steel will ignite items in inventory.

     Adapting vanilla mechanics:
     * Lava should be capable of igniting anything >=L1. This means
       a custom material that is flammable.
     * Fire should spread according to a probability that is
       proportional to the flammability. This is easy to support. But
       what about modeling the ambient temperature? Not right now.
       
     In vanilla, liquids (water) extinguish torches. But what happens
     when a flammable fluid attempts to flow into a torch? Probably
     should ignite with the same probability as fire spreading.

**** Reactivity
     Will explode, depending on temperature/force:
     * Level 1: explodes if heated > 200 C
     * Level 2: explodes if heated > 100 C
     * Level 3: explodes if near any heating or another explosion 
     * Level 4: explodes whenever thrown (or anything from L3)

     L4 has explosive radius of TNT; otherwise creeper radius.
     
**** Special
     * Water reactive: obviously blows up when contacts water!
     * Asphyxiant: when exposed, count down as if underwater, then pain
     * Oxidizer: fuels existing fires
       
*** Solutions
    A solution consists of a solvent and a solute, which is present in
    some concentration. Modeling the full continuous range of
    concentrations would be too complicated. Instead, we have two:
    dilute (0.1M) and concentrated (10M). The solubility of the
    solvent determines wheter a particular concentration is
    feasible. We therefore really only need three levels of
    solubility: very soluble (can form concentrated solutions),
    soluble (can form dilute solutions), and insoluble (does not form
    solutions).

    Just for reference, from Sigma Aldrich (units in mL/g):
    | Very Soluble          | Less than 1         |
    | Freely Soluble        | 1 to 10             |
    | Soluble               | 10 to 30            |
    | Sparingly Soluble     | 30 to 100           |
    | Slightly Soluble      | 100 to 1000         |
    | Very Slightly Soluble | 1000 to 10,000      |
    | Practically Insoluble | Greater than 10,000 |
    
*** Temperature
    We will not model arbitrary temperatures of materials, except
    within machines. Instead, we assume room temperature or the
    transition temperature to the phase closer to room
    temperature.

    There is a point at which thermal radiation becomes visible, and
    we essentially render liquids as lava.

    | Temperature           | Color                       |
    |-----------------------+-----------------------------|
    | 480 °C (896 °F)       | faint red glow              |
    | 580 °C (1,076 °F)     | dark red                    |
    | 730 °C (1,350 °F)     | bright red, slightly orange |
    | 930 °C (1,710 °F)     | bright orange               |
    | 1,100 °C (2,010 °F)   | pale yellowish orange       |
    | 1,300 °C (2,370 °F)   | yellowish white             |
    | > 1,400 °C (2,550 °F) | white                       |

** Tools
** Batteries
   In increasing order of cost and energy density:
   * Lead acid
   * NiMH
   * Lithium iron phosphate
     
** Plastics
   Plastics could serve as alternative to metal in many items. Would
   be produced from petroleum processing.
   
* Chemical Processing
** Unit Operations
   These are the physical units of chemical engineering. Many of these
   involve automatic transport of a material, separation of mixture
   components based on physical properties, and changing the physical
   form of a material. Since physical processes are relatively
   straight-forward, we should be able to auto-generate unit
   operations, without any explicit declarations.

*** Fluid flow
**** Transport
***** Fittings and valves
      Fittings connect pipes, as well as measure and regulate flow
      through pipes. Buildcraft should provide enough here.
      The table below outlines this. We have excluded trivial
      connections between pipes. 

      | Type         | BC                   | Notes                    |
      |--------------+----------------------+--------------------------|
      | Cross/Tee    | Iron pipe            | 3>1 output, with cycling |
      | On/Off valve | Iron/Wooden pipe     | redstone signal          |
      | Check        | Iron pipe            |                          |
      | Regulating   | Gates                |                          |
      
***** Pipes
      BC has us covered here. One issue is temperature. Might
      temperature (difference from ambient) degrade over time, much
      like electricity? Then there are different types of
      insulation. This will not match-up well with the existing use
      of steam, molten redstone, etc.
      
***** Pumps
      BC has a pump.
      
***** Compressers
      We can use BC pipes to move gases as a fluid, but we need the
      equivalent of a pump, except for gas. It would collect gas from
      the atmosphere. If nearby a machine that emits gas freely (like
      a furnace) it will collect the gas and output to a pipe. This
      is the fan from GasCraft.
      
**** Filtration
     The idea here is to separate solid phase from liquid phase.
     
**** Fluidization
     The inverse of filtration: turning a solid into a liquid by
     infusing it with water or gas. Just a type of mixing.

*** Heat transfer
    Heat (energy) transfer from one substance to
    another. Applications:
    * Heat exchanger: efficient transfer between fluids
    * Thermal energy storage: e.g. insulated water tanks (could store
      Railcraft steam in a tank)
    * Electricity generation: thermopile (RP2)

    Most interesting for processing (i.e., distillation) is the heat
    exchanger, which could either a condenser (cooling) or
    evaporator/boiler (heating). Railcraft already has a great boiler
    system that we could leverage. Need a condenser.

*** Mass transfer (separation)
    Moving chemicals from one solution/phase to another. Forms the
    basis of fluid filtration. See section on separation.

*** Mechanical
    Mostly working with solids.
    
**** Solid transportation
     Trust BC/AE here.
    
**** Crushing, pulverizing
     Many machines already perform this for ore processing. Examples:
     * IC2 macerator (1 output)
     * TE pulverizer (2 outputs)
     * GT industrial grinder (4 outputs)
     
**** Screening/sieving
     Presumably this is how the pulverizer and grinder separate
     materials. 
     
** Unit Processes
   These are types of chemical (rather than physical)
   processes. These are somewhat orthogonal to machines. But we list
   them to make sure we support these types of chemistry:
   * redox: ore reduction in furnace, electrolysis
   * (de)hydrogenation
   * hydrolysis
   * (de)hydration
   * (de)halogenation
   * (de)nitrification
   * (de)sulfonation
   * (de)alkylation
   * esterification
   * polymerization
   * polycondensation
   * catalysis

   A chemical process has an associated process chemistry, which in
   many cases can be represented as a system of chemical
   reactions. There are some cases, such as in the refining of crude
   oil, or food production, that specifying individual reactions would
   not be feasible, so some abstraction is necessary. Many chemical
   reactions, and chemical processes, can be autogenerated using some
   heuristics, but many will require manual declaration, given the
   complexity of chemistry.
   
** Separation
   There are different methods of separating/purifying compounds:
   * Filtration: depending on filter media, the solid/liquid
     equivalent of solvent extraction
   * Decantation/Settling: tanks that over time would separate solid
     and liquid
   * Distillation: leverage heat transfer processes to partially
     evaporate, then condense. The Forestry still and the brewing
     stand are close, but neither of them would work. Probably best
     to model this as a combination of heat transfer components.
   * Precipitation: would happen in chemical reactor, but then the
     solid phase needs to be separated.
   * Crystallization: uses a special solvent to cause one fraction to
     crystallize; as in Factorization's crystallizer. 
   * Centrifugation: based on differences in density, basically an
     accelerated version of settling.  The GT industrial centrifuge is
     the only real existing option.
   * Sieves: difference in particle size. We can imagine that the TE
     pulverizer and GT grinder work this way.
   * Extraction:
     * Leaching: Dissolve some fraction of a solid (usually via a
       reaction); simple if water, could use the Forestry carpenter,
       and then boil.
     * Liquid-liquid: Relies on solubility differences b/w solvents;
       this would typically involve mixing another solvent into a
       mixture and then letting it settle. Representing multi-solvent
       mixtures may be complicated. Another issue is that the two
       solvents will likely be water and a non-polar organic solvent;
       organic chemistry is complicated.
   * Adsorption: sticking to a surface, as in cyclonic separation;
     may be too similar to filtration
   * Magnetic: could work for magnetite, otherwise...
    
   How to model this? We could track actual phase transition
   temperatures, densities, particle size, etc. But that would be
   crazy. A more abstract model: a list of chemicals that compose a
   particular ore/mixture, possibly with percentages. The number of
   separated chemicals will depend on the number of outputs for a
   machine. Are the outputs always pure (simplest) or could they also
   be mixtures themselves? This would present opportunities for chain
   processing. Are some only separatable by certain techniques?

*** Distillation
    Components of a distillery:
    * Heater/boiler (e.g., steam powered)
    * Distillation column, consisting of multiple blocks
    
    At each level of the distillation tower, gas may be extracted and
    condensed. The higher the tower, the finer the separation. The
    boiler sits next to the base of the tower. The "bottoms" liquid
    can be extracted from the bottom of the tower. Optionally, a
    vacuum can be attached to the top, for when the temperature has
    an upper limit (petroleum refining). In theory, the heat gained
    by the condensers could be transferred to the boiler, i.e, they
    would take in water and emit steam, which would flow to the
    boiler, although the boiler would need additional steam.
    
*** Gravity-based separation
    This relies on materials having different specific gravities.

    Types:
    * Settling :: A multiblock settling tank could take a mixture at
                  the top and yield one or more solids (one from each
                  of the bottom blocks) depending on the relative 
                  densities. The more blocks, the more liquid that
                  can be processed. This is simpler and cheaper than
                  spiral separation, but proceeds much more
                  slowly. One could claim that Gregtech's support for
                  throwing ore into a cauldron is similar to
                  this. Could we support automation with hoppers?
    * Spiral :: Spiral sluice relies on gravity to accelerate
                materials down the incline, with the denser materials
                tending toward the middle. No energy required.
    * Centrifuge :: Spins an object so that its contents separate by
                    density through centrifugal force. This requires
                    a lot of energy. This already exists in IC2 and GT.
    * Cyclonic :: A cyclone of fluid (liquid or gas) is established,
                  denser particles hit the wall and fall
                  out. Liquid/solid separators are called
                  hydroclones. These require liquid under pressure and
                  thus some energy.
    * Shaking Tables :: Shake it, denser particles fall to bottom. No
                        need for liquid here. Requires some energy,
                        pretty slow.
    * Jig Beds :: Fluidized bed with pulsing water instead of
                  shaking. Works faster than shaking tables but
                  material will need to be dried. This is most similar
                  to the IC2 ore washing machine.
    
    Centrifuge recipes:
     | Input       | Output                   |
     |-------------+--------------------------|
     | Monazite Cl | CeCl:50 LaCl:25 NdCl: 15 |
     |             |                          |

*** Leaching
    Some substances are obtained through water leaching and then
    boiling off the water. The leaching machine will take one solid
    and one liquid input, and yield a liquid, fairly slowly. Depends
    on solubility.

   | Input    | Output            |
   |----------+-------------------|
   | charcoal | pearl ash (K2CO3) |
   |          |                   |
    
*** Froth Flotation
    Desired ore is derivatized (via a collector) to become more
    hydrophobic. It is mixed into a water bath, and air bubbles rise
    through the bath, capturing the hydrophobic ore
    constituents. This is mostly used for sulfide ores.

    The machine would accept air (from a compressor) and the ore
    slurry (from mixer with collector).

    Important collectors:
    * (K/S)EX (K/Na ethyl xanthate): Cu, Ni, Ag, Au extraction
    
    Froth flotation should convert the sulfide ore to the sulfide
    mineral, which effectively doubles ore output. Should be possible
    to recover the collector.
    
*** Drying
    This means removing water from an aqueous solution to yield a
    purer liquid from the solute. The fluid is passed over/through
    some matrix that reacts with the water, removing it from solution.

*** Electrostatic
    Conductivity-based separation. Useful for small particles like
    mineral sands (rutile and ilmenite are conductive, the rest are
    not). Also, cassiterite. Requires some energy to maintain the
    electric field. No slurry required.

    This lists some conductivity values and outlines sand processing:
    http://www.iluka.com/docs/mining-and-processing/mineral-separation.pdf
    
*** Magnetic
    Uses a magnetic field instead of an electric field. Requires some
    energy for the electromagnet. Useful for magnetite ores. Advanced,
    high-powered separators can separate ores containing iron (like
    ilmenite).

    See: http://pubs.usgs.gov/of/1999/ofr-99-0529/
      
** Reactions
   A chemical reactor performs some combination of these functions:
   * mixing
   * separating
   * heating
   * cooling
   * pressurizing

   A key question is whether these tasks are performed by separate
   machines or one monolithic reactor. The most fun would be separate
   machines. See next sections for further discussion.
   
*** Model
    We want to model the following aspects of reactions:
    * Reactions can be endothermic (require energy) or exothermic
      (require heat management, might explode!)
    * The feasibility and rate depend on the temperature
    * Reactions may need a catalyst
    
    The heat released or absorbed would change the temperature
    according to some heat capacity. For a liquid reactor, one might
    use the heat capacity of water. If it boils, there will be an
    explosion if there is no way to pipe out the steam. The pressure
    exerted on the reaction vessel would be equal to the vapor
    pressure of the liquid.
    
    To determine whether a reaction is feasible, we consider the sign
    of the free energy. This has nothing to do with how fast the
    reaction proceeds; it only helps to decide the trajectory of the
    system: which one is most thermodynamically favorable? The
    magnitude of the free energy is an indicator of the completeness
    of the reaction (how much reactant is left at equilibrium). We
    will assume that all reactions proceed to completeness.

    The rate also depends on the temperature. This dependency is
    pretty simple IF we know the activation energy:
    ln(k2/k1) = -(Ea/R)(1/T2 - 1/T1). We could calculate that by
    summing the bond energies:
    http://www.wiredchemist.com/chemistry/data/bond-energies-lengths
    That would be manual. If the rate constant (k) is not known for a
    reaction, then we would need to assume some base rate.

    Perhaps we could have a base, reasonable rate that corresponds to
    the temperature at which a reaction becomes spontaneous. Increases
    in that rate then follow the Arrhenius equation.

    So in summary, we need to know:
    * The dH and dS for the reaction, computed from the Hf and S of
      the reactants and products
      * OR the dH and the temperature for the reaction
    * The Ea for the reaction, rate constant and order of the reaction
    * Any catalysts
    
    Sometimes, such as in liquid extraction, the required temperature
    is not derivable from chemical parameters. In those cases, we
    need to override the reaction temperature. And there are probably
    many other cases where some ideal temperature is known, without
    knowing the kinetic parameters. That suggests at least two kinetic
    models:
    1. One where the rate constant, rate law and Ea are known, and we
       accurately model the rate by temperature, concentration, etc,
    2. One where the rate is either zero or some non-zero number,
       depending on the temperature.
         
**** Model inspired by actual chemistry
     We want to react two aqueous solutions. The machine mixes a
     certain amount of each, in molar proportion. The mixing is
     continuous, in sub-bucket increments, so there is no complete
     flush of the reactor.  If the reaction is thermodynamically
     favored at the temperature (25 C), it begins at some base
     rate. Otherwise, heat exchangers (as separate blocks adjacent to
     the reactor) are necessary for bringing the temperature up to
     some pre-defined target temperature. The more heat exchangers,
     the quicker the heating. The reaction rate will change based on
     the temperature, and the temperature changes according to the
     heat of reaction. The reator will output at the maximum rate at
     which it can maintain the temperature. There will be some cap on
     the output rate, and if heat is in excess, and there is no
     cooling mechanism, the temperature will increase.  Once the vapor
     pressure of the liquid matches the pressure, it will boil. If
     there is no gas output, the pressure will increase until it
     exceeds the pressure tolerance (which depends on the
     construction), and there is an explosion.

**** Model inspired by Minecraft smelting
     Smelting is the closest thing in Minecraft to a chemical
     reaction. In fact, it *is* a chemical reaction.
     Key differences:
     * Chemical reactions usually involve at least one fluid-phase
       reactant, i.e., either a liquid or a gas; the gas in smelting
       is produced by burning fuel (how do electric furnaces work?).
     * A chemical reaction might be exothermic, unlike the
       typical reduction during smelting.
     * In general, an endothermic chemical reaction will need an
       external heat source, because there is no burning fuel.
     One similarity is that the speed of the smelting depends on the
     input energy (e.g., TE smelters).

     So the main difference is the need to model heat and
     temperature. That introduces the most complications.

     So how do we simplify the thermodynamics to determine the burn
     time for each fuel? We can equate the burn time to the amount of
     heat released by a fuel. That depends on the amount of fuel and
     the enthalpy change for the reaction at some fixed furnace
     temperature (say, 1000K). For the crude fuels, we provide that
     enthalpy change directly, in kJ/g. We assume that a block of coal
     is a cubic meter, we scale to a lump (1/9), and get the mass from
     the density. We then normalize bituminous coal to vanilla coal to
     get the actual burn time.
     
**** Case study
     Take as an example the Bayer process for producing aluminum from
     bauxite. Start with the first reaction, the pressurized
     extraction of aluminum hydroxide from bauxite in a concentrated
     NaOH solution. Aluminum hydroxide is insoluble in water, but it
     is soluble in hot NaOH (aq), because of the reaction that
     converts the Al(OH)3 to NaAl(OH)4 (aq). So we could simply say
     that the solubility depends on the rate of that reaction. But
     finding chemical parameters for compounds like NaAl(OH)4 is
     going to be tough. And in the end, they are unlikely to predict
     the reality of the Bayer process. After filtering the red mud,
     the solution is cooled, and Al(OH)3 precipitates.

     These guys wrote a whole paper on modeling this:
     http://www.ysxbcn.com/down/upfile/soft/20120228/32-p0447.pdf
     
     How could we simplify this?
     * Instead of modeling the exact thermodynamics, simply state
       that bauxite/Al(OH)3 is "hot" soluble in NaOH, and
       precipitates after cooling. The ore and NaOH solution would be
       mixed in a heated, HP reactor. In effect, we would just be
       coming up with all of our own parameters. 
     * Simplify this to something like induction smelting, except with
       a heated liquid, instead of burning fuel, with red mud as the
       slag. The NaOH solution could just be a bucket in the
       induction smelter (but we would probably want our own machine
       with liquid pipe support). This may be too simple. We sure as
       heck would not want to use the induction smelter for every one
       of our reactions.
     
     We could probably do both: the underlying model understands the
     solubility of Al(OH)3, and that translates to specific,
     simplified recipes.

     A tougher problem: monazite, a mixture that consists of the
     poorly characterized rare earth phosphates. These would need to
     be coded as stubs. That is better than not at all.
     
*** Reactors
    The reactor will be a multi-block structure, modeled after the
    Railcraft tanks. Like the Railcraft steam boiler, there will be a
    low and high pressure version of the reactor. The high pressure
    boiler can super-heat liquids to cause reactions to occur at a
    faster rate. There will be special blocks.
    Here is a list of blocks:
    * Mixer block: placed in bottom, middle; crafted like gauge,
      except using iron gears in place of glass, redstone engine in
      the middle.
    * Low/high pressure structure block
      * Must be uniform, all HP or LP
      * Use iron tank wall for LP, steel plate recipe for HP
    * Glass blocks: Railcraft gauge
    * Heat transfer components
      * Recipe: like valve, but with plates and bars switched
    * Temperature gauge: like tank gauge, with redstone coil in middle
    * Pressure gauge: like tank gauge, with pressure plate in middle
    * Liquid valve: just the Railcraft tank valve
    * Gas valve: tank valve but with steel instead of iron
    * Solid dispenser: tank valve with dispenser in middle
    * Safety valve: releases gas when temperature gets too high;
      replace middle of tank valve with trap door?

** Solubility
   It would be simple to model compounds as being soluble by groups
   of solvents (polar, non-polar, etc). The problem is temperature
   dependency: this can be huge. Solubilities in water are fairly
   well known, http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solubility_table.
   But what about other solvents? Probably best to model solvation as
   a reaction (a phase change). Then we just have to worry about
   reactions.

   Also, what about concentrations? Simplest would be to have one,
   fixed concentration. Slightly more complicated would be two levels:
   dilute and concentrated. Dilute might be one pile of dust in a
   bucket, while concentrated would be 10 piles.

   Interestingly, one can approximate the temperature dependence on
   solubility via the Arrhenius equation, where the heat of fusion
   (the latent heat) is the activation energy.
   See: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Enthalpy_of_fusion
   But since we are not modeling concentrations, how is the
   solubility meaningful? Perhaps as the rate? Technically no, the
   solubility only indicates the equilibrium point in terms of the
   amount of solute, relative to the amount of solvent. In other
   words, it decides whether a dilute and perhaps concentrated
   solution is feasible.

   Also, we are ignoring boiling point elevation and melting point
   depression in solutions.
   
** Mixing
   Need a machine to mix solids, liquids and gases. Technically, this
   is a challenge, because it would require modeling mixtures of
   fluids. In theory, we could have a mixture liquid using
   damage. This would support up to ~16000 chemicals in binary
   mixtures. For arbitrary mixtures during processing, binary is
   probably sufficient. Ores will be more complex, but those can be
   modeled individually.

   Types of mixers we would want:
   * combining two fluids or gases
   * dissolving a solid or absorbing a gas into a solution
   * combining a solid and fluid to a slurry
   * mixing two solid dusts

   All of these take two inputs and emit one output, or two outputs
   when there is a solid/liquid plus a gas. The difference really are
   three types of input: two fluids, two solids or a fluid and a
   solid.  These correspond to liquid agitators, dust blenders and
   fluidizing beds, respectively.
   
** Temperature
   Fluids will need to be heated and cooled. If a reaction occurring
   in a mixture releases or requires heat, then cooling or heating
   must be applied to the reaction chamber. One type of heater would
   be a simple electric heater, but heat transfer devices would be
   more efficient. Steam/water could be piped into the heat
   transfer device, and they would emerge in a cooled or heated form
   (steam would become water, water steam). Heat exchangers are
   typically made from stainless steel, as well as Cu/Ni and Ti.

   Does the reaction mixing chamber itself require temperature
   control? In real life, this is the case, but how to model it? The
   device already has 3/4 material connections, plus power. This would
   be two more connections. May be workable. The simple electric
   heating chamber is also an option. Or a separate block. Multiblock
   structures sound the most attractive.

   In fact, heating/cooling of fluids outside of the chamber may
   present technical complications: each "temperature" of each liquid
   would need to be registered. Or maybe we could analyze the network
   to determine what the temperature should be? That *might* work
   since the temperature is not an inherent property of the substance
   (like its composition). To store a chemical at a temperature, a
   heated/insulated tank is necessary. Wait for use cases.

   The reaction chamber would need some temperature limit. If the
   temperature exceeds the limit, bad things happen.

   
*** Heat Capacity
    We will mostly get this from the Shomate equation (Cp is
    temperature dependent), but here is a simple table for common
    substances (J/gK):
    
    | Cellulose      |           1.34 |
    | Clay           |           0.94 |
    | Coal           |   1.09 to 1.55 |
    | Concrete       |           0.65 |
    | Diamond        |           0.61 |
    | Fireclay brick | 1.25 (1500° C) |
    | Glass (pyrex)  |            0.8 |
    | Limestone      |           0.91 |
    | Rubber         |           1.74 |
    | Sand           |            0.8 |
    | Silk           |           1.38 |
    | Steel          |           0.50 |
    | Wood           |     1.9 to 2.7 |
    | Wool           |           1.36 |

** Pressure
   Modeling pressure means modeling the atmosphere inside the
   reactor. There is some atmosphere inside the chamber. When the
   vapor pressure exceeds the internal pressure, gas from evaporation
   changes the pressure.
   
*** Vapor pressure
    This is via the Antoine equation, which requires three
    constants. For mixtures, we can use the weighted average via
    Raoult's Law. We only have the Antoine coefficients for common
    liquids; should be sufficient. In fact, might as well assume water
    for now.
    
*** Evaporation rate
    This is Langmuir's approximation:
    dn/dt = (pv - p)*sqrt(1/(2*pi*R*T))
    
** Electrolysis
   Electrolysis will reduce just about anything. If we know the
   chemical formula of the substance, we can easily calculate the
   product of redox reactions. IC2 has an electrolyzer for making
   energy cells, or something. GT has a much more interesting
   one. But we probably need a smelting electrolyzer to deal with
   e.g. bauxite processing.
   
*** Chloralkali process
    Produces NaOH (aq) and Cl2 (g) from NaCl (aq). This happens in a
    membrane cell. This could be a multiblock structure that would
    essentially be two reactors combined, separated by a thin
    ion-selective membrane. Each reactor would have an electrode. 

*** Electrowinning
    A more complicated form is electrowinning/refining. This requires
    dissolving the metal in H2SO4 and performing electrolysis. The
    anodes would be need to be transferred to a grinder for recovery
    of the metals. This means that electrodes need to be continually
    manufactured and replaced; perhaps every 10 buckets of
    electrolyte. Partial yields from grinding partially mature
    electrodes should be allowed. A number of minor outputs are
    possible from grinding the dust.

** Smelting
   Types of smelting:
   * Roasting/calcining: conversion of sulfide and carbonate ores to
     oxides. This occurs at low temperature; any furnace is capable.
   * Reduction: conversion of oxide to elemental metal. Requires
     reducing agent like coal or sand.
     
   Furnaces and smelting is central to Minecraft, so we do not want
   to change that dramatically; however, we could add more
   sophisticated smelting options, with higher yield.
   
   Some types of furnaces:
   * Electric arc: passes an electric current through the material,
     reaching temperatures of about 2000K, mostly for steel making.
   * Blast furnace: reduces metal, usually iron, by blasting air up
     through the furnace; with a pre-heated blast, can reach
     temperatures up to 2500K; can also produce rock wool from diabase
     rock.
   * Induction furnace: induces current in metal using an electomagnet
     magnet; used for melting metals.
   * Bath smelting: blows O2-enriched air into a bath of slag at the
     bottom; useful for smelting sulfide ores.
   * Flash smelting: sulfide ore is mixed with O2, ignited, sulfur is
     produced as a solid, rather than SO2.
   
   Possible reduction progression (ingot:ore/dust):
   * Vanilla furnace and other simple furnaces (1:1)
   * Induction smelter (1:1 + slag), requires coal/sand, lower energy
   * Industrial blast furnace *Fe only* (2:1 + 2 slag), requires coke,
     limestone flux and air input; oil, tar, natural gas can be added
     to the coke to lower energy requirements (and increase speed). GT
     has since added something with this name.
   
   Possible roasting progression:
   * Vanilla furnace and other simple furnaces (1:1)
   * Fluidized bed roaster: twice as fast (2:1), requires air to be
     pumped into the chamber
   
   Chemical/thermodynamic considerations of smelting:
   * After roasting/calcining, any sulfide, carbonate, or hydroxide
     ores have been converted to oxides.
   * A reducing agent is necessary, because the temperature required
     to achieve thermodynamic feasibility would be impractically high
     for many metal oxides, even with positive entropy change of O2
     gas production.
   * Carbon is the typical reducing agent, because its oxidation to
     CO2 is favorable, especially at high temperatures; by combining
     the metal-producing reduction step and CO2-producing oxidation
     step, the overall process becomes favorable.
   * There is one complication: some metals react with carbon to form
     carbides. This includes Cr, Al, ...
   * This can be solved by using metals with less favorable reduction
     potential, i.e., metals that want to be oxidized more. An
     example is oxidizing Al to reduce the oxide of Cr. Note that
     while this favorability holds true for a large range of
     temperatures, there is a high activation energy that requires
     some initial ignition. See the notes on the aluminothermic
     reaction -- we need a charge in a crucible, not a smelter.
   * By registering carbide reactions, we can avoid adding smelting
     recipes for them.
   * But for Al, we need to rely on electrolysis, and that is tricky.
   * Otherwise, we will use thermodynamic considerations to determine
     the smelting temperature, and could even allow reducing agents
     other than carbon in a principled way.

   Reactivity could give us:
   * Rough decomposition temperature of hydroxides, carbonates and nitrates
   * Reduction potential (electrolysis vs. smelting)
   * Reactivity with water, acids
   * Single displacement reactions
   Some of that could be derived from thermodynamics, but the
   reactivity also includes some notion of kinetics.

   Possible breakdown:
   * Low :: Ge Sb Bi Cu Hg Ag Mo As Pt W Au
   * Medium :: Mn Nb V Zn Cr Ta U Fe Cd Co Ni Sn Pb (H)
   * High :: Li Ba Sr Ca Mg Be Al Ti (C)
   * Very High :: Cs Rb K Na
   But for some things, like reduction and single displacement, we
   need an actual ordering.

   Decomposition temperature by reactivity for each type of compound:
   | Compound   | Low | Medium | High           | Very High |
   |------------+-----+--------+----------------+-----------|
   | Carbonates | Low | Low    | Med/High/VHigh | NA        |
   | Sulfates   |     |        |                |           |
   | Nitrates   |     |        |                |           |
   | Hydroxides | Low | Low    |                | NA        |
   
   See this for thermal decomposition:
   http://www.docbrown.info/page07/sblockb.htm#11.

   Smelting energy depends on the necessary temperature.

*** Mod integration
    Many mods add basic furnaces. Those are integrated via the ore
    dictionary. But we also need realistic smelting with reductants. 

    Possible machines for reduction:
    * Multi-smelter [Engineer's Toolbox]
    * Induction smelter [Thermal Expansion] : 2=>1(+1)
    * High oven [Tinker's Steelworks] : 1(+3 modifiers)=>liquid
      
    One problem is that mods tend to conflate metal dusts with crushed
    metal ores. Obviously, the metal dust is already reduced (and
    might result from grinding an ingot), while the ore still requires
    processing. Even mods that distinguish metal dusts from ores do so
    only with regard to purity, not chemistry. Tinker's Steelworks is
    the only one that pretends to do chemistry (but has no idea what
    it is doing). The player will get whatever the
    grinder/pulverizer/macerator/etc produces.  We need to be careful
    with the ore dictionary, so that only crushed ores are valid input
    to smelting. These would be the keys "crushed" and
    "crushedPurified" (eg: crushedTin).

*** Blast furnace details
    Reference:
    http://www.steel.org/Making%20Steel/How%20Its%20Made/Processes/How%20a%20Blast%20Furnace%20Works.aspx

**** Process
     The blast furnace will accept ore, flux (limestone) and fuel
     (coke) from the top, and accept heated, compressed air (the
     blast) from the bottom, potentially with oil, natural gas, tar,
     powdered coal and/or oxygen to increase the heat. The mixture
     accumulates at the bottom of the furnace, where air is blown,
     optionally (for higher efficiency) heated by cowper furnances,
     through special pipes called /tuyeres/, which are made of copper
     and cooled with water. The tuyeres are located one (or two, to
     keep slag separate?) block above the base of the furnace. Coke at
     the same level as the tuyeres, or 1 above, 2 below, is ignited,
     producing heat and CO. The heat and CO rises up through the stack
     of limestone and ore, converting the limestone to slag and the
     ore to liquid iron, which settles in the space below the
     tuyeres. About 40% of the CO is converted to CO2 by the reactions
     on the way out of the furnace. This "dirty gas" exits the furnace
     at the top.

     A cowper stove is a simple regenerative heat exchanger via
     convective heat transfer, where the dirty, hot gases escaping the
     top of the furnace heat refractory bricks that then transfer
     their heat to convert the cold blast to a hot blast. There must
     be at least two (usually three) stoves, because there is only one
     gas flow. First, the top gas is passed through to heat the
     bricks, then the blast air.

     The limestone flux is important for capturing silica before it is
     reduced to silicon. The limestone is converted by the heat to
     calcium oxide, which reacts with silica to form the slag, calcium
     silicate (CaSiO3).

     The flue gas contains mostly CO, CO2 (from the reduction) and N
     (from the air).

**** Chemistry
     The temperature needs to be carefully maintained at each level of
     the furnace, so that the desired reactions are favored.

     The initial burning of the coke produces CO2 (and heat), but the
     CO2 is immediately reduced to CO by the excess of C:
     C + O2 => CO2 + heat
     CO2 + C => 2CO

     At the level of 1600 C, limestone decomposes to form CaO that
     cleans out the sulfur:
     CaCO3 => CaO + CO2
     FeS + CaO + C => CaS + FeO + CO

     Near the top of the stack, at 850 C, hematite is reduced to
     magnetite by CO:
     3 Fe2O3 + CO => CO2 + 2 Fe3O4

     Further down, magnetite is reduced starting at 1100 C:
     Fe3O4 + CO => CO2 + 3 FeO

     The reduction finally completes starting at 1300 C (bosh):
     FeO + CO => CO2 + Fe

     The liquid iron is actually a mixture that contains about 4% C,
     which makes it "pig iron".
     
**** Structure
     The typical overall shape is something like 3x10, up to 5x15, but
     any size is supported as long as there is room for the process.
     
     The structure will consist of structural blocks, plus these
     special modules:
     * Tuyeres :: Bottom, the more tuyere nozzles, the hotter/faster
     * Iron notch :: Bottom, for releasing the molten iron
     * Cinder notch :: Bottom, for releasing slag and iron (later
                       separated by a skimmer unit)
     * Hoppers :: Top, deposit the "charge" of ore, flux and coke
     * Uptake valves :: Top, through which dirty gas exits
     
     The structure must be cuboid. The larger, the more ore that can
     be smelted at once.

     Here are some details on the blast furnace structure:
     http://ispatguru.com/refractory-lining-of-blast-furnace/

     There are several levels:
     * Throat :: reduction of Fe2O3 to Fe3O4 @ 850 C,,
     * Stack :: reduction of Fe3O4 to FeO @ 1100 C, 
     * Belly :: reduction of FeO to Fe @ 1300 C, 
     * Bosh :: where the coke is burning, and slag is forming, iron is
               melting,
     * Hearth :: where the liquid iron/slag collects, below the tuyeres
     
     The top (throat and stack) of the furnace could consist of simple
     firebricks.  A firebrick consists of blocks of a vitrified
     fireclay, which is essentially kaolinite, i.e., a mixture of
     alumina and silica.  The more alumina (from bauxite), the better.
     
     Kaolinite and bauxite would be ground up, pulverized and mixed
     2+2=4 to create a mixture that is calcined to firebricks.
     Refined alumina can be combined with ordinary clay 2+2 to yield a
     mixture that also smelts to (4) firebricks. Seared brick and
     infernal brick would also be allowed.

     The belly of the furnace could be lined with silicon carbide
     (calcined quartz sand and carbon) bricks, bonded with silicon
     nitride. Or corundum-based bricks. These would consist of
     mullite + brown corundum
     (http://www.alteo-alumina.com/en/corundum) + SiC + SiN3
     binder. Mullite is essentially kaolinite fired at high
     temperature (1400 vs. 950 C, coke oven?), or the electric furnace
     fusion of alumina (bauxite) with silica (quartz sand). Infernal
     brick would also be allowed.

     The bosh layer, where the fire is the hottest, would consist of
     the same types of blocks from the belly, plus the tuyere blocks,
     which are constructed with either corundum, SiC, or carbon
     bricks, described below.

     For the very base of the furnace, one needs carbon bricks, as
     described here:
     http://ispatguru.com/carbon-blocks-used-for-blast-furnace-hearth-lining/

     Basically, a mixture of carbon-based materials. Pulverized
     coal/petroleum coke, or calcined anthracite, and/or graphite are
     bound (by baking) with coal tar (extra heavy oil), bitumen or
     some sort of phenolic resin. Recipe would be pulverized coal/pet
     coke or calcined anthracite + graphite + SiC + 1 binder (bucket
     of extra heavy oil, bitumen or phenolic-formaldehyde resin),
     yielding something that bakes to one brick
     block. Phenolic-formaldehyde resin (PF) is a simple polymer that
     forms when phenol and formaldehyde are heated together.

**** Air blowing
     Methods of blowing the air:
     * Bellows :: air cavity that is expanded and compressed; typically
                  manually, perhaps by water wheel
     * Blowing engine :: steam engine that drives air pumping
                         cylinders; no longer in use
     * Centrifugal fan :: fan with impellers that push air; also called
          turbo blowers

**** Implementation
     Many existing mods provide the necessary components. While
     PneumaticCraft is about compressing air, the intent is more about
     sending signals and energy via air, much like BC kinesis pipes,
     before the switch to RF.
     
     * Centrifugal fan :: The centrifugal fan can be implemented as a
          simple, single-block machine. It accepts air input from any
          side except the output side, which pushes entities and
          outputs compressed air into fluid pipes. We should also
          support PneumaticCraft air.
     * Notches :: Closest thing is TiC's smeltery drains, but these
                  would need to be carbon-based, instead.
     * Tuyeres :: Needs to be a custom block that accepts compressed
                  air and releases it into the furnace, based on
                  refactory bricks,
     * Firebricks :: Specific types of brick, as described above, at
                     least for the process to actually work.
                     
     The overall idea is for the tuyere blocks to drive the
     process. Whether it actually succeeds or not depends on how the
     furnace is constructed, which ingredients are added, etc.

     Outline of the process:
     * Dropper/dispenser/whatever drops items into furnace. Tuyere
       blocks capture those items and cause them to stack up, from the
       bottom to top, in a 3x3x3 arrangement within the air blocks. It
       does not matter which tuyere block captures the item; the items
       are arranged consistently.
     * Each tuyere block ignites coke within some radius of itself,
       and the coke releases CO gas, i.e., the bosh becomes filled
       with CO source blocks. The tuyere block does this by finding a
       reaction between the coke (C) and compressed air (O2): 2C + O2
       => 2CO + heat. Somehow we also have to track the "heat", which
       is really the temperature of the gas, so we expect the gas
       (which is actually a mixture of CO, CO2 and N) to model
       the temperature. Some of that heat is absorbed by later
       reactions, while the rest is lost through the structure
       (depending on the heat transfer coefficients). As the coke is
       consumed, items higher in the stack fall down.
     * As the gas diffuses, it reacts with the ore and limestone, and
       the products of earlier reactions. Product items replace
       reactant items.
     * Eventually pig iron is produced, which melts in the bosh to
       produce liquid pig iron, which settles in the bottom. Slag also
       accumulates.
     * There is a drain block that extracts whatever fluid is on the
       other side of it, either iron or slag, depending on height.
     * There is a vent block that captures the gas and pipes it out.
     
     The gas could be a fixed mixture, or we could use tile entities
     to track the individual component concentrations, in addition to
     the temperature.
     
** Pyrolysis
   Another type of cooking is pyrolysis, thermal decomposition without
   combustion: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyrolysis. We could use the
   coke oven for this. If a distillation tower is employed to separate
   the products, we have destructive distillation.
   
*** Destructive distillation
    Here is one recipe:
    Coal => Coke + NH3 (l) + coal tar (l) + coal gas
    This will not work in the coke oven, obviously, because coal
    directly yields creosote oil. Perhaps we could distill (using the
    Forestry still) creosote oil to yield NH3?

    More:
    wood => charcoal + guaiacol + tar + terpenes + turpentine + methanol
    bituminous coal => coke + naphthalene + anthracene + pyrene
    rubber => isoprene
    compost/plantballs => biochar + NH3
    
** Roasting
   Cooking with very hot air, typically to convert sulfide ores to
   oxide ores.
   
** Ore processing
   More complex chemistry happens when extracting metals from
   ore. Preprocessing of mineral ores involves these unit operations:
   * Comminution :: Simply grinding/pulverizing, converting the ore
                    block to the ore dust
   * Sizing :: Selecting the particles by size; could be simple
               screens or could rely on different settling velocities
               (things like cyclones and trommels). We can probably
               ignore this step.
   * Concentration :: Concentrates the mineral in the ore, effectively
                      converting the ore to the mineral. Concentration
                      is complicated, and there are many methods (see
                      separation section):
     * Gravity/density-based
     * Chemical, e.g. froth-flotation
     * Electrostatic (for mineral sands)
     * Magnetic (mostly for iron-containing minerals)
   * Dewatering :: If a slurry is formed during separation, the water
                   needs to be removed. Perhaps by filtering,
                   sedimentation, or drying (requires more energy).
   
   The rest of this section describes how each specific ore can be
   processed into economic material. 
   
*** Magnetite
**** Iron
     Typical smelting of oxide ores.
     
**** Vanadium
   Vanadium is typically isolated from magnetite and ilmenite ore,
   and some times carnotite (uranium) ore. It can also be extracted
   from flue dust of heavy oil, phosphate ore slag and bauxite. Here
   we focus only on extraction from magnetite.
   
   In the induction smelter, magnetite ore + sand => iron +
   magnetite slag. That slag is then resmelted with sodium
   carbonate/chloride/sulfate, or lime at 850 C to produce crude
   NaVO3 dust. This is leached with water and ammonium vanadates are
   precipitated with ammonia. The ammonia is decanted and the
   precipitate is roasted to V2O5. To get elemental vanadium, we
   need to smelt V2O5 with CaCl2 or aluminum dust. Thus, the overall
   process is smelt, smelt, leach/precipitate/decant, roast and
   smelt. The roasting and smelting is already possible. A fluid
   reactor would mix the NaVO3 (aq) and ammonia, resulting in an
   mixture of aqueous ammonia and solid vanadate. A liquid/solid
   separator yields the vanadate powder for roasting.
     
*** Limonite
**** Iron
     Basic smelting, 1250 C.
     
**** Nickel: yellow limonite only
     High temperature (250 C) leaching of ore with sulfuric acid
     precipitates the iron as hematite. The NiSO4 can then be
     precipitated as a sulfide with H2S gas treatment (100 C). At this
     point, the sulfide could be roasted and smelted like pentlandite
     to yield Ni. If cobalt is desired, the sulfides need to be
     redissolved as sulfates by treatment with pure O2 at high
     temperature. Solvent extraction with Cyanex 272 separates the
     cobalt in the organic phase. The sulfates can then be reduced via
     electrolysis or H2 gas.

     Another idea is to reduce the metal sulfides and add Cl2 or ozone
     to oxidize the Co to Co(OH)3, which is insoluble in acid. Say
     about 20 buckets of Ni extract for one Co ingot.
     
*** Chalcopyrite 
**** Copper
     * 1x :: ore =smelt=> 1*copper_ingot
     * 2x :: ore =crush=> 2*ore_dust =smelt=> copper_ingot
     * 3x :: ore =crush=> 2*ore_dust =float=> 1.5*chalcopyrite_dust =smelt=> Cu
     * 3x+ :: 2*chalcopyrite_dust =smelt+silica=> 
              chalcocite_dust + Fe-rich slag (1) + SO2 =smelt=> 2*Cu
     * 4x :: chalcocite_dust =roast=> 1.3*cuprous_oxide_dust + SO2  =smelt=> 2*Cu
     
     * (1) :: If ore dust is input, slag is not Fe-rich
       
     Like most sulfide ores, we concentrate with froth flotation,
     roast to oxide, and smelt to the metal. But the iron impurity
     requires us to smelt with silica to separate the iron in the slag
     phase.

**** Cobalt
     The copper oxide is dissolved in sulfuric acid, and the cobalt is
     CoSO4. The copper is electrolyzed, and NaOH is added to the spent
     electrolyte to precipitate Co(OH)2, which is electrolyzed to
     Co. Lets say 20 buckets of spent electrolyte are required for
     one Co ingot.

**** Molybdenum
     After froth flotation, perform another flotation with NaHS
     added, which keeps copper from frothing, thus separating the
     molybdenite, which is processed as normal.
     
**** Minor: Silver, Gold, Platinum, Selenium, Tellurium
     Electrorefining of blister copper. The copper gathers at the
     cathode, while the noble metals are deposited as the "anode
     slime". The Ag, Au, Pt, and Cu form compounds with Se and Te,
     which are reduced by roasting at 500C in the presence of Na2CO3
     and air. So for Te:

     M2Te + O2 + Na2CO3 -> Na2TeO3 + 2M + CO2

     The sodium tellurite is then leached with water, and adding
     sulfuric acid precipites the tellurite as TeO2, which can be
     reduced with electrolysis, or by adding SO2 to aqueous TeO2. 
     
**** Antimony
*** Pentlandite
**** Nickel
     Typical sulfide ore extraction.
 
**** Cobalt
     The same as with chalcopyrite.
     
*** Sphalerite
**** Zinc
     As with all sulfide ores.
     
**** Cadmium
     Fractional distillation, or: Crude zinc oxide (after initial
     roasting) is treated with H2SO4, and seeded with zinc dust to
     precipitate metal impurities, which are filtered out. An excess
     of zinc dust is added to precipitate CdSO4. That is redissolved
     in H2SO4 and electrolyzed with Al(+) and Pb(-), and Cd is
     deposited at the cathode.

**** Gallium
     Crude zinc oxide is treated with H2SO4 to yield various
     sulfates. Neutralizing the solution precipitates the iron,
     aluminum and gallium sulfates. Treatment with NaOH brings the
     aluminum and gallium back into solution. Neutralization
     precipitates, and HCl treatment produces gallium and aluminum
     chloride. GaCl3 is dissolved in ether, treated with NaOH and
     electrolyzed to produce Ga.
     
**** Germanium
     GeS2 is roasted with GeO2, and the Zn and Ge are extracted with
     sulfuric acid. The solution is neutralized to precipitate only
     GeO2. This is converted to GeCl4 by Cl2 gas or HCl, and the GeCl4
     is purified by distillation. GeCl4 is hydrolyzed back to GeO2,
     which is reduced with H2 or C to Ge.
     
**** Indium
     
*** Galena
**** Lead
     Like any other sulfide ore.
     
**** Silver
     TE pulverizer already yields silver dust from lead ore.
     
**** Antimony
**** Vanadium (vanadinite)
     Just like with magnetite, roasted (850 C) in presence of Na2CO3
     or NaCl to produce sodium metavanadate.
     
*** Spodumene
**** Lithium carbonate
     Treat with H2SO4, roast, leach with water and precipitate with Na2CO3.
     
*** Lepidolite
**** Lithium
     Like spodumene => Li2CO3. See lepidolite ore dust reaction.
     
**** TODO Caesium
     Need to figure this out.
     
**** TODO Rubidium
     
*** Dolomite
**** Magnesium
     Ground dolomite is roasted in the presence of ground
     FeSi to produce a mixture of CO2 and Mg gas, as well as CaSiO3
     (wollastonite) mixed with iron dust. Distillation tower separates
     and condenses the Mg. 

     FeSi results from induction smelting sand and iron (maybe an iron
     nugget, because the ingot recipe already exists).
     
**** Calcium
     
*** Rock salt
**** NaCl
     Just grind it up.
     
**** KCl
     Dissolved in brine and heated, so that the KCl and NaCl are
     enriched in a solution. Heat transfer pipe cools the solution,
     and the steam can be used for the heating of the brine. The
     cooling causes the KCl to precipitate. This is separated through
     e.g. centrifugation (settling will not work, because the NaCl
     will precipitate). The left over solution can serve as the brine
     in the initial step.

     Or aminate the KCl and use froth flotation.

**** Carnallite
     This is MgCl2*KCl*6H2O, i.e., MgCl2 and KCl complexed by
     water. Dehydration (in a dryer), followed by melting the MgCl2
     (but not the KCl) at 700-750C leads to separation of MgCl2 and
     KCl, with a small amount of MgO produced through hydrolysis. The
     MgO can be converted back to MgCl2 through chlorination during
     melting (MgO + C + Cl2 => MgCl2 + CO/CO2, worth it?).
     
*** Limestone/Marble
**** Calcite (GT)
     Grind to yield CaCO3, plus a 5% chance of CaMg(CO3)2 (dolomite).
     
**** Calcium
     Electrolysis of CaO (roast product of CaCO3) or aluminothermic
     reaction, which involves the reduction of CaO with Al, under
     high temperatures. These temperatures are typically attained by
     surrounding the CaO/Al charge with a mixture of Mg and BaO2.

     Something like:
     3CaO + 2Al => Al2O3 (slag) + 3Ca

     Could allow crafting of an aluminothermic charge (Al+Mg+BaO2).
     It would be placed in a fired clay crucible and ignited with
     flint and steel. There will be flames; nearby things could burn.

     BaO2 comes from oxidizing BaO (roasting or O2 absorbtion), and
     BaO results from heating BaCO3 with carbon. BaCO3 is formed by
     heating (60-70 C) BaS (barite) with NaCO3 (soda ash). Or heated
     CO2 absorbtion. The absorbtion would need to happen in a mixer,
     while the other recipes could be handled by the induction smelter.
     
*** Skarn
**** Calcium
     
*** Uraninite
**** Uranium
     Most uranium ores (UO2) are acid leached with sulfuric acid,
     which might be preceded by roasting.

     The uranium is extracted from the sulfuric acid leach via
     liquid/liquid extraction, with the solvents di(2-ethylhexyl)
     phosphoric acid and a secondary/tertiary amine (2.5% amine, 2.5%
     isodecanol and 95% kerosene) as the solvents.
     
     Kerosene comes from oil refining, but the tertiary amine that
     reacts with uranium would be complicated to synthesize. For
     simplicity, let us aim for only ethyl or methyl amines. Those
     can be synthesized from ethanol/methanol and ammonia using a
     zeolite catalyst.

     Reference:
     https://publications.csiro.au/rpr/download?pid=csiro:EP112117&dsid=DS3

     Anyway, the acid leach is treated with ammonia, which
     precipitates yellowcake: (NH4)2U2O7. There are other types of
     yellowcake, like UO3 and U3O8. (NH4)2U2O7 thermally decomposes to
     UO3 at 500 C. This in turn decomposes to U3O8 at 750C.

     Anyway, for enrichment, yellowcake must be refined by treatment
     of (NH4)2U2O7 with nitric acid to yield UO2(NO3)2.  Uranium is
     extracted from the solution using two solvents: tributyl
     phosphate and kerosene. This yields a purified UO2(NO3)2. It
     should be noted that during reprocessing of nuclear fuel, fuel
     rods can be dissolved with HNO3 to UO2(NO3)2.
     
     This is converted to UO2 via thermal decomposition at 500C to
     yield UO3, which is reduced with H2 gas to UO2.  This is the
     ceramic form of unenriched uranium, and it is useful for fuel
     rods and heavy-water reactors.

     The UO2 is treated with HF to yield UF4. To produce U metal, use
     magnesium/calcium/aluminum thermite reduction (essentially UF4 is
     enveloped in a Mg charge that is ignited in a crucible; highly
     exothermic). Ignition occurs between 500-700 C and reaches in
     excess of 1300 C. The slag is 2MgF2.
     
     For enrichment, the UF4 is instead oxidized with fluorine to UF6
     and enriched for 235 by fractional distillation or one of the
     other enrichment methods. UF6 then is brought back to UO2 by
     reacting as a gas with water vapor to UO2F2-H2O, which is reduced
     with H2 gas to UO2.
     
**** Vanadate
     After treating ore with the tertiary amine, mix with the sodium
     carbonate and follow the steps for magnetite. This is actually
     the mineral carnotite, which is probably associated with uraninite.
     
*** Chromite
**** Ferrochromium
     Smelt with coal at high temperature (2800 C); lots of energy. As
     a reference, iron is smelted around 2000 C.

*** Magnesite
**** Magnesium
     Calcined to MgO (magnesia), which is then smelted with Si in
     induction furnace to produce Mg (s) and SiO2 (sand). Could be
     combined into one step.
     
*** Rutile
**** Refining
     Rutile is TiO2. It is refined by mixing in a fluidized bed at
     900C with Cl2 to make TiCl4 (caution: exothermic), fractionally
     distilling it and then oxidizing TiCl4 back to TiO2 in a pure O2
     flame (caution: exothermic, the Cl2 gas can be recovered).
     
**** Titanium
     See the reactions for TiO2.
     
*** Ilmenite
**** Titanium
     Convert to TiO2 (rutile), then follow the listed reactions. TiO2
     is produced by treating ilmenite with sulfuric acid at 100C (Ea
     64 kJ/mol), which separates the iron as FeSO4. The FeSO4 is
     crystallized and filtered out. This requires a settling out the
     liquid FeSO4 and then cooling it to a solid. The solid phase in
     the settling tank is washed to obtain TiOSO4. That is hydrolyzed
     (boiled) to hydrous TiO2, which needs to be roasted to pure TiO2.
     
*** Garnierite
**** Nickel
     Simply smelt it. In an induction furnace, include a sulfur
     source, like gypsum, for flux.

     Or perhaps more realistic are hydrometallurgical processes, by
     which metals are leached with sulfuric acid at 250C and high
     pressure (or wait 3-4 months!). The leach solution is neutralized
     with limestone, and the precipitated Ni hydroxide is roasted
     to NiO and smelted.
     
*** TODO Cassiterite
**** Tin
     From smelting.
     
**** Niobium/Tantalum
     
*** Wolframite
    Gravity concentration.
    
**** Tungsten
     WO3 is reduced at 800C with H2 (producing steam). Getting to WO3
     is more complicated. Mix ore with aqueous soda ash, add ammonia
     to form ammonium para tungstate (APT), which precipitates (after
     boiling off the water) and is calcined to WO3.

**** WC (tungsten carbide)
     Induction smelt tungsten ore with coke.
     
*** Scheelite
    Concentrated by froth flotation.
    
**** Tungsten
     The same as wolframite.
     
*** Cinnabar
**** Mercury
     http://mysite.du.edu/~jcalvert/phys/mercury.htm#Prod
     Looks like it is found only in fine-grained massive forms, so
     very little metal will be obtained per ore. The ore is roasted,
     and mercury is distilled from the vapors.
     
*** Bauxite
**** Aluminium
    Dissolved in concentrated NaOH (aq) at 150-200 C (in pressure
    vessel) to yield aluminate. The red mud is filtered out, and
    Al(OH)3 is precipitated by bubbling CO2 through the solution
    (neutralizing the NaOH with carbonic acid). That is calcined to
    become Al2O3. Cryolite is added as a flux and the mixture is
    melted at 1000 C. Then electrolysis yields Al (s). The GT
    electrolyzer requires a lot of energy to process bauxite dust. We
    could have Al2O3 increase yield significantly. But that would not
    incorporate the notion of the cryolite.

    Cryolite is Na3AlF6, which can be synthesized as:
    6 NaOH + Al2O3 + 12 HF → 2 Na3AlF6 + 9 H2O

    Note that the cryolite is not consumed in the process.

    This will require some special machine, a smelter/electrolyzer,
    that requires less energy than using straight electrolysis.
    
**** Gallium
     Gallium can replace Al in gibbsite, Al(OH)3. Ga(OH)3 ends up in
     solution with Al(OH)3. Even after precipitation of the aluminum,
     there is still too much aluminum in the solution. This is removed
     by either adding CaCO3 (precipitating the Al as CaAl(OH)5?) or by
     passing CO2 through the solution to neutralize it and precipitate
     Al(OH)3. The concentrated gallium solution is electrolyzed to
     produce Ga.
     
**** Red mud
     In theory, one could mix the mud with coke and and smelt with an
     electric arc furnace. The Fe2O3 is converted to pig iron. The
     slag could be made into rock wool. This is not cheap but is
     barely economically viable.
     
*** Zircon
    Separated from sand using spiral separators. The rutile and
    ilmenite are removed by magnets.
    
**** Zirconium
     Same process as for rutile=>titanium.
     
*** Stibnite
     
**** Antimony
     Much like other sulfide ores. Enriched with froth flotation,
     roasted to oxide, then reduced in an induction smelter with
     coke. Or directly induction smelted with Fe, producing Sb and
     FeS slag.
     
*** Borax
**** Boron
     Three methods, increasing purity:
     * Smelting of B2O3 with Mg or Al. The B2O3 is obtained by
       treating borax with H2SO4 in a fusion furnace (750 C).
     * Reduction of volatile boron halides with H2 at high
       temperature.
     * Thermal decomposition of diborane.
     
*** TODO Pyrolusite
*** Pollucite
**** Caesium
     Caesium is highly reactive, with both water and air. Seems like
     this is mostly produced during Li production, but here are some
     options:
     
***** Acid digestion
      Add Hcl to eventually yield CsCl (evaporate water). Analogous
      reactions happen with HBr and HF.
      
      Or add sulfuric acid => caesium alum, induction smelt with coke
      and leach with water to yield Cs2SO4 (aq). This could be used
      for caesium formate production.

      CsCl is reduced at 700-800C with Ca or Ba in induction smelter. 
      
***** Alkaline decomposition
      Induction smelt with mixture of CaCO3 and CaCl2, leach with
      water to yield CsCl. 
      
***** Direct reduction
      Induction smelted with Na, K or Ca metal (expensive, maybe
      consumes twice the metal).

***** Electrolysis
      Elecrolyze CsCN. How to get this?

***** Thermal decomposition
      Cook CsN3 at 400C. Seems complicated. Should increase
      yield. Relevant reactions:
      
      2 CsSO4 + Ba(N3)2 → 2 CsN3 + Ba(SO4)2
      2 NaN3 + BaX → 2 NaX + Ba(N3)2
      2 NaNH2 + N2O → NaN3 + NaOH + NH3
      2 Na + 2 NH3 → 2 NaNH2 + H2
    
**** Rubidium
     The caesium alum can be fractionally crystallized to yield tiny
     amounts of rubidium.
      
*** Bastnasite
**** Cerium
     Treated with H2SO4 to make water soluble sulfates. NaOH is added
     and thorium hydroxide precipitates. Ammonium oxalate precipitates
     rare earths as oxalates. They are heated to oxides and dissolved
     in HNO3, leaving behind insoluble cerium salts. Those can be
     induction smelted with Ca or melted and electrolyzed.

     Oxalic acid:
       NH4OH + oxalic acid -> ammonium oxalate
       glucose + HNO3 (or air) --V2O5--> oxalic acid

     Nitric acid:
      * Large scale at 500K, pressurized air for O2: 
        4 NH3 (g) + 7 O2 (g) → 4 NO2 (g) + 6 H2O (g) [platinum/Rh catalyst]
        4 NO2 (g) + 2 H2O (l) → 4 HNO3 (aq)
      * Small scale:
        2 NaNO3 (s) + H2SO4 (aq) → 2 HNO3 (aq) + Na2SO4 (s)
        
      NaNO3 is produced from NH3, perhaps via HNO3 (air with platinum
      catalyst, 700-850 C). 2HNO3 + soda ash => 2NaNO3 + H2O + CO2.
      There are other ways, like via NH4NO3. Should also be
      obtainable from RC saltpeter (various nitrate salts).
      
*** Tantalite
    Gravity separation.
    
**** Tantulum/Niobium
     Treated with HF to yield complex fluorides. Those are separated
     by liquid extraction, with water/cyclohexanone as the
     solvents. Both niobium and tantalum are extracted. The tantalum
     (or niobium) fluoride is precipitated by addition of KF, and the
     result is reduced with molten Na.

     Cyclohexanone results from oxidizing cyclohexane in air with Co
     catalyst. Cyclohexane results from reducing benzene. This means
     mixing gaseous benzene and H2 with a Pt or Raney Ni catalyst
     under high temperature. Cyclohexane is then condensed.

     Benzene results from oil refining. 
     
*** Molybdenite
**** Molybdenum
     Like any sulfide, it is roasted to an oxide at 700C. It can then
     distilled (sublimated at 1100C) or dissolved in ammonia. To get
     molybdenum metal, reduce with H2 gas.
     
**** Ferromolybdenum for steel
     Aluminothermic reaction w/ the purified oxide and iron.
     
**** Rhenium
     Rhenium oxide is filtered from the gas during roasting,
     leached with water and treated with NH4Cl to precipitate
     ammonium perrhenate. It can be reduced with hot H2 gas.
     
*** Malachite
**** Copper
     Smelt it.
*** Glauconite
**** Fertilizer
     Smelt, and leach with HCl to make KCl.
     
*** Alunite
**** Alum
     Calcined at low heat, leached with water, evaporated.
     
**** Potassium
     Roasted at 1000C to produce K2SO4 and Al2O2. The K2SO4 is water
     soluble and can be leached off, filtered and the water is
     evaporated.
     
**** Aluminum
     Alumina is the filtrate after roasting and water leaching.
         
*** Fluorite
**** HF
     Dissolve in H2SO4.
     CaF2 + H2SO4 → 2 HF + CaSO4
     HF is also a by-product of making phosphoric acid from apatite.

**** Cryolite
     See Bauxite section.
     
*** Graphite
**** TODO Graphene

*** Barite
**** Barium
     Like any sulfide ore (froth flotation, etc). Except if induction
     smelted with aluminum or silicon dust, the yield is doubled.
     
*** Celestine
**** SrCO3
     Two methods:
     * Direct leaching :: Leach with Na2CO3.
     * Black ash :: Induction smelt with coal dust to 2 black ash,
                    leach SrS with hot water, treat with
                    Na2CO3/NH4CO3. This doubles yield vs. direct leach.
     
**** Strontium
     Produce 2x SrO dust by induction smelting SrCO3 with coal
     dust. Roast that to Sr. Or smelt SrCO3 directly for one
     yield. Or directly smelt SrSO4, which consumes a lot of energy
     and offers no gain via the black ash method.
     
*** Apatite
    Beneficiation: after grinding, purify through froth flotation
    after coating with fatty acid (doubles yield).
    
**** Fertilizer
     Fertilizer needs to provide some combination of three
     nutrients: nitrogen, phosphorous and potassium.

     Pure phosphorous fertilizer is phosphate, P2O5, but it is
     typically combined with NH3 for N+P fertilizer.  Treat with
     H2SO4, separate out resulting gypsum and H3PO4. Neutralize H3PO4
     with NH3. Yields 2 fertilizer per dust.

     Alternative for N+P: treat apatite with HNO3 to make H3PO4 and
     Ca(NO3)2 mixture.

     Pure N fertilizer is typically NH4NO3, formed by treating NH3 (g)
     with HNO3 (aq). And then dried. The reaction is extremely exothermic. 

     For K, simply add KCl (2 NP fertlizer + 1 KCl -> 3 NPK).

*** Arsenic sulfides
    Many sulfide ores contain arsenic sulfide minerals like realgar
    and arsenopyrite. These volatilize upon roasting of the ore at
    500-800C. The gases are burnt in O2 to produce As2O3, which is
    condensed at ~100C, leaving SO2 in the gas phase. 

**** Arsenic
     Arsenic metal results from reduction of As2O3 with carbon at 500-800C. 
     
*** Beryl

** Coal
   There are three main types of coal that represent increasing stages
   of metamorphosis from peat:
   * Lignite
   * Bituminous coal
   * Anthracite
   As one progresses from lignite to anthracite, the amount of fixed
   carbon increases compared to the impurities of moisture (water),
   volatiles (aliphatic and aromatic hydrocarbons), ash (rock), and
   sulfur.

   The breakdown is something like:
   | Coal       | Moisture | Volatiles | Ash | Fixed Carbon |
   |------------+----------+-----------+-----+--------------|
   | Lignite    |      40% |       25% |  5% |          30% |
   | Bituminous |      15% |       15% | 10% |          60% |
   | Anthracite |       0% |        0% | 10% |          90% |

   The volatile fraction should be lighter in lignite than bituminous coal.

   Then we can process it:
   http://sophiadacycole.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/coal_tree_USGS.jpg

   Pyrolysis of coal yields coke and tar. Unfortunately, the Railcraft
   coke oven yields creosote oil as the liquid fraction, instead of
   tar. Creosote is a distillation product of tar. Depending on the
   process, different ratios of gas (CO, H2, CH4, etc) are released.

   Some options:
   * We could replace that recipe with one that yields tar, and then
     add a recipe for the Forestry still that yields creosote from
     tar. But that depends on Forestry; eventually we would have our
     own, multiblock still.
   * Introduce lignite as its own item, and have it yield tar in a
     coke oven, along with coke, but take more time. Anthracite would
     be a direct coke replacement.
   * Just replace coal entirely with lignite, bituminous coal and
     anthracite.
   
   The heat value of the coal depends on the carbon content. While
   both lignite and bituminous coal produce coke, it takes longer for
   the lignite, due to the additional moisture. While we could add
   lignite coke, which would be smaller than ordinary coke, we just
   yield one type of coke for simplicity (they have the same
   composition). One could argue that we just start with more lignite,
   which still has a lower heat value due to the moisture.
   
   Good reference for relative heat contents:
   http://www.euronuclear.org/info/encyclopedia/coalequivalent.htm

   Upgrading: lignite can be upgraded to bituminous coal by drying in
   a rotary kiln.

** Oil and natural gas refining
   This is the most complex chemical process. Many materials will be
   derived from petroleum.

   Here is a good book: "Petroleum refining in nontechnical language".
   Available from the Palo Alto library.

   For chemistry, Google Books has this:
   "The Chemistry and Technology of Petroleum"
   
*** Resources
    Oil can be found in liquid deposits, or can be produced from
    kerogen-rich oil shale, with veins of so-called liquid "tight"
    oil. Oil shale also contains pockets (perhaps vein-like fractures)
    of natural gas (called shale gas).  Alternatively or in addition,
    shale could yield shale gas by chance when broken (like gravel
    yielding flint). However, most natural gas occurs in isolation or
    in association with oil (above).

    Natural gas is mostly methane (95%), with some amount of
    ethane (3%), and propane (0.2%). 

    There are about 150 types of crude oil on the market, typically
    classified along two axes: heavy/light (density) and sweet/sour
    (sulfur content). The two variables are correlated: the heavier,
    the sourer. Extremely heavy/thick oil is called bitumen. The
    chemical composition can also vary. Hydrocarbons up to C4 (butane)
    are usually dissolved gas (natural gas).

    With regard to shale, while tight oil is light, shale oil probably
    falls under the "extra heavy" category.
    
    From this we could come up with this composition for each type:
    | Type        | Alkanes | Naphtha | Aromatic | Asphalt |   H2S | Occurrence |
    |-------------+---------+---------+----------+---------+-------+------------|
    | Light       |     50% |     45% |       5% |      0% |  0.5% |        10% |
    | Medium      |     40% |     48% |      10% |      2% | 0.75% |        20% |
    | Heavy       |     30% |     50% |      15% |      5% |    1% |        15% |
    | Extra heavy |     15% |     45% |      30% |     10% |    2% |        25% |
    | Oil sand    |     10% |     20% |      50% |     20% |    3% |        30% |

    Densities from light to extra-heavy: 0.8, 0.9, 1.0, 1.1

    But that is just chemical composition. In terms of crude fractions
    and products:
    | Type        | Fuel gas | L Naptha | H Naptha | Kerosene | LGO | HGO | Res |
    |-------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+-----+-----+-----|
    | Light       |      10% |      40% |      30% |      10% |  5% |  0% |  5% |
    | Medium      |       5% |      15% |      35% |      20% | 10% |  5% | 10% |
    | Heavy       |       0% |       5% |      15% |      25% | 25% | 10% | 20% |
    | Extra heavy |       0% |       0% |       5% |      10% | 15% | 20% | 50% |
    | Bitumen     |       0% |       0% |       5% |      10% | 15% | 20% | 50% |

    The main difference between extra heavy and bitumen is the
    viscosity: bitumen is highly viscous.
    
    GasCraft generates shale oil and gas, and Buildcraft generates
    oil, although in weird fountains.
    
*** Unit Operations
**** Atmospheric distillation
**** Desulfonation
     Sulfur compounds will interfere with catalysts, so they are
     removed by treatment with H2 to form H2S (g). That is then
     removed by: H2S + ZnO -> ZnS + H2O.
     
**** Catalytic reforming
     Reforms the heavy and sometimes light naphta streams into more
     complex, higher octane hydrocarbons. There are four reactions:
     * Dehydrogenation :: changes naphtenes to aromatics like toluene
     * Isomerization :: creates isoparaffins from paraffins
     * Aromatization :: creates aromatics from paraffins
     * Hydrocracking :: breaks paraffins into shorter paraffins

     The liquid naphta is mixed with H2, the mixture is heated to
     vaporize the naphta and they enter the reactor with the
     platinum/rhenium catalyst. The result is cooled to condense the
     hydrocarbons. This process must be preceeded by desulfurization.

     Aromatics can be separated by extraction with diethyl glycol or
     sulfolane. Distillation separates compounds like benzene.

     Diethyl glycol comes from reacting ethylene with air (or O2 is
     faster) w/ Ag catalyst to produce ethylene oxide. Ethylene
     oxide is useful for all sorts of things. It is converted into
     ethyl glycols by mixing with water at 200C. Distillation
     separates mono/di/tri-ethyl glycols.

     Sulfolane results from reacting butadiene with SO2 and reacting
     the resulting sulfolene with H2 (g) w/ Pt or Raney nickel
     catalyst.  Raney nickel is an Ni/Al alloy, activated by Zn or Cr.
     
**** Steam cracking
     This breaks naphtas into smaller hydrocarbons. Naphtas are mixed
     with steam and heated to 850C, then cooled. Light naphta
     generates ethylene (and propylene/butadiene), while heavier
     naphtas generate benzene (and toluene/xylene). Distillation
     separates the components.

**** Steam reforming
     Produces H2 from hydrocarbons:
     At 700-1100 C, endothermic, via Ni catalyst,
     CH4 + H2O => CO + 3H2

**** Gas-shift
     Produces H2 from the CO left over from steam reforming.
     At 300 C, with magnetite catalyst,       
     CO + H2O => CO2 + H2
     
*** Streams
**** Light naphta
**** Heavy naphta
*** Recovered waste products
**** Vanadate
     Coke from oil refineries contains vanadium. The coke is leached
     using sulfuric acid and then ammonium vanadates are precipated,
     as from magnetite.

** Food processing
   http://www.nzifst.org.nz/unitoperations/
   
* Manufacturing
** Processes
   Basic processes:
   * Casting/molding: shaping a material as liquid, then solidifying.
     - Perhaps the only mod that casts molten metal is Tinker's Construct.
     - Perhaps no mods attempt to model plastics.
   * Forming: reshaping of solid metals, plastics, without losing material.
   * Machining: cutting a material into a specific shape.
   * Joining: connecting two objects.

*** Casting
    Types:
    * Centrifugal :: For making cylindrical shapes, like pipes and
                     buckets. Materials: iron, steel, glass, aluminum,
                     copper, nickel.
    * Continuous :: Produces billets, blooms and slabs for easier
                    rolling. This usually happens at the time of
                    smelting. Metals: steel, aluminum, copper.
    * Die :: Forcing molten metal into a cast. Metals: Zn, Cu, Al, Mg,
             Pb, pewter, Sn. Produces large quantity of small castings.
    * Investment :: For most intricate casts; traditionally based on
                    beeswax, now foam. Expensive. Metals: Fe, Al
                    alloys, steel, Ni alloys.
    * Sand :: Sand casts are the most common. Actually a mixture of
              sand, clay and refactory materials.
    * Permanent mold :: Mold made from metal.
    * Shell mold :: Like sand casting, but mold is a shell formed with
                    sand mixed with resin. Since mold is expendable,
                    more complex shapes can be cast.
    * Spray :: Semi-liquid metal is sprayed onto a substrate.
      
    We could have smelting machines that output molten metal prior to
    casting. The metal could be piped to a particular casting unit,
    such as a continuous caster to produce billets that are cheaper
    to form in e.g. a rolling machine. With the exception of
    centrifugal casting, the different casting methods are mostly
    distinguished by the type of mold. Thus, we could have one
    primary casting machine that accepts different types of
    molds. The type of mold required depends on the product.
    
*** Molding
    * Powder metallurgy :: Metals shaped as powder, then heated to
         bind. This could be a heater using metal dusts as input
    * Plastics :: 

*** Forming
    * Forging :: Applying localized pressure to draw out, shorten,
                 squeeze, etc, a metal. Like the GT Forge Hammer.
    * Rolling :: Squeezes metal between two rollers to make plates and
                 rods. Provided by RC.
    * Extrusion :: Pushing/pulling a substance into a mold.
    * Pressing :: Pressing a pattern onto a material.
    * Shearing :: Cutting stock into smaller pieces.
    
    The RC rolling machine and GT forge hammer may be sufficient.
    
*** Machining
    * Milling :: Rotary cutter, workpiece advanced at angle to tool
                 to remove material.
    * Turning :: Workpiece is turned against linear cutter. The
                 Gregtech lathe is one example.
    
    It seems the simple GT lathe is sufficient. There is also a
    potential manual equivalency in forge multipart and its diamond saw.
    
*** Joining
    
** Products

* Research
** Chemical Compounds
   The player could research the properties of chemical compounds in a
   realistic manner. Lab equipment and instruments would be crafted
   and applied to some compound. The lessons learned would be recorded
   in a lab notebook, which has limited durability (becomes filled
   with notes). Once all properties are known, the compound may be
   used in industrial processes (put into production). The trick is to
   research efficiently, without wasting notebooks and other
   resources. All knowledge ends up in a searchable chemical reference
   book.

** Ore deposits
   By default, all ores will be modeled as veins. PFAA will not
   actually generate any ores. Instead, we will provide a COG config.

   First, internal deposits. Magmatic processes separate ores either
   along a temperature gradient or through solubility
   differences. The latter generates metal sulfides.  Hydrothermal
   action also typically generates sulfides, since sulfur is able to
   carry the metal in the aqueous phase. 

   The surficial deposits generally consist of oxides. These need to
   be processed very similarly to sulfides. Do we distinguish between
   oxides and sulfides? It would present interesting
   chemistry. Sulfides are a source of PGEs, especially with Ni, Cu,
   Cr and Co. Perhaps more importantly, the SO2 produced by smelting
   can be reclaimed as sulfuric acid. The obvious disadvantage would
   be the need for additional block IDs. It also opens the door to
   modeling specific minerals.  The advantage would be that minerals
   could be used for other purposes. Mostly, these relate to coloring
   and other decorative aspects. Nothing wrong with that.

   Some specific types of ore deposits:
   
   | Deposit                    | Occurs                               | Ores                                                    | Minerals                                              |

   Placer deposits could be modeled by shoveling a black sand, with a
   gold nugget as a rare drop. Pulverizing generates 1 magnetite
   dust, with a 10% chance of gold nugget. Use of a magnet
   (factorization) would also separate magnetite.

   Banded Iron Formations consist of a single, banded
   block. Pulverizing yields 2 hematite dust, with 20% chance of
   magnetite dust. The hematite can be hydrated to red dye, or
   smelted to iron, like magnetite.

   Laterite soils are a type of clay, except cooking is not necessary
   to produce bricks. They can be simply crafted into bricks. It is
   found only within jungles. Within the laterite, there will be
   child veins of bauxite (25%), and iron ore (75%). The lateritic
   iron ore is of two types: yellow and brown (ochres).  When
   pulverized, they yield the corresponding dust, plus a 5% chance of
   nickel ore dust. The dusts can be smelted to iron, or hydrated to
   brown or yellow dye. Smelting is a one-step process for the blast
   furnace, while for other furnaces the ore is first smelted to
   hematite, which is smelted to iron.

   Marine evaporite deposits will consist of limestone, under gypsum,
   under rock salt. Grinding limestone yields calcite + some chance of
   dolomite. Grinding gypsum yields the mineral itself + 20% native
   sulfur. Grinding rock salt yields halite + 50% sylvite. Perhaps
   grinding sylvite could yield MgCl2, say 20% of the time. Borax and
   soda ash occur in lake evaporites (desert-hills only).

   The VMS deposits occur through feslic volcanic activity in
   mid-ocean rifts and continental back-arcs (ice mountains). The
   morphology is globular, with chalcopyrite at the bottom and
   sphalerite/galena towards the top. Gold at the top.

   There is some desire to balance the distribution of ores between
   biomes, so we outline them here by biome:
   
   | Biome         | Rocks                                        |
   |---------------+----------------------------------------------|
   | Continental   | sedimentary, granite, diorite                |
   | Extreme Hills | rhyolite, andesite, granite, diorite, gabbro |
   | Oceanic       | limestone, basalt, gabbro                    |

   | Biome          | Ores                                        |
   |----------------+---------------------------------------------|
   | Continental    | dolomite, coal, BIF, LI, SEDEX              |
   | Extreme Hills  | volcanic ash, 2*LI, carbonatite             |
   | (Frozen) Ocean | 2*dolomite, 2*VMS, LI, 2*SEDEX, 2*BIF       |
   
   These are all considered continental:
   | (Ice) Plains    | evaporite, 2*iron                 |
   | Beach           | basaltic/granitic/garnet sand     |
   | (Frozen) Rivers | granitic sand                     |
   | Desert (Hills)  | quartz sand, evaporite            |
   | Swamp           | 2*coal, laterite                  |
   | Jungle (Hills)  | laterite                          |
   | Ice Mountains   | VMS, 2*iron, granitic/garnet sand |
   | Taiga (Hills)   | 2*iron                            |
   | Forest (Hills)  | conglomerate bowls                |

*** Special consideration: Biomes o' Plenty
    Most BOP biomes will be caught by the biome dictionary
    matching. There are some that are special though:
    * Alps :: Collision of European and African plates, was once an
              ocean between. The tallest reaches are metamorphic,
              i.e., gneiss (primarily), schist, greenschist, etc,
              while the rest tends to be sedimentary, consisting of
              greywacke (a sandstone that is like a fine-grained
              breccia), limestone (primarily) and mudstone. Beneath
              the alps one finds the gabbro/basalt that underlied the
              ancient sea, as well as some granitic
              intrusions. Perhaps we could model all folded mountains
              as being mudstone, then limestone and then gneiss at the
              peak, in other words, start with the ocean but instead
              of the basalt islands, switch to continental.
    * Wasteland :: Evaporite deposits.
    * Badlands :: Formations largely sedimentary, inter-mixed ash.
    * Volcano :: Basalt instead of sediment.
    * Hot Springs :: Rhyolite near the surface, instead of
                     sed. Intermixed with volcanic ash, pumice, etc.
    * Outback :: Primarily sandstone.
    * Highlands :: Modeled as the Scottish Highlands, we would have
                   (green)schist/slate on top, with lower regions
                   consisting of sandstone (primarily) and
                   conglomerate. Serpentinite veins throughout.
    * Glacier :: Could model as Yosemite, with granite domes.
    
    BOP bugs:
    * Chapparal is not plains but rather hills. 
    * Are the tropical and plain rainforest mixed up in temp/rain?
    * Mountain has its min/max height set twice?
    * Why are fen and moor not typed as a swamp?
      
** Native metals
   The following native metals are relatively common:
   * Gold
   * Silver (usually w/ gold as electrum)
   * Copper
     
   And various PGE metals occur, often as alloys:
   * Platinum
   * Osmium (+ Ir, Ru)
   * Iridium (+ Os + Ru)
   * Ruthenium (+ Ir)
   * Palladium (+ Pt)
   * Rhodium (+ Pt)
   
   Native copper (10%), gold (10%), electrum (5%) could be dropped
   from conglomerate and mineral sands. The other native elements
   would require more advanced processing. Realistically, copper
   nuggets are much rarer than gold nuggets, but in terms of gameplay,
   it would be interesting to force initial copper extraction to
   nuggets.

** Extra planets and moons
   Eventually, we want to include all planets (including exoplanets)
   and moons (including psuedo-randomaly generated ones). 

*** Mars
**** Physical properties
     * Mass: 0.107 Me
     * Gravity: 0.376 g
     * Temperature: -143/-63/35
     * Pressure: 6 mb (Humans require: 61.8 mb)
     * Atmosphere: 95% CO2, 3% N2, 2% Ar
     * Crust thickness: 50km (Earth: 40km)
     * Light intensity: 44% of Earth

**** Crust composition
     There is a thin layer of dust (regolith). The red color is caused
     by iron oxide, mostly in the form of magnetite (TFC), and hematite
     (TFC) + goethite (TFC). The magnetite causes the dust to be
     magnetic. The bulk of the dust consists of pulverized plagioclase
     feldspar (say, labradorite), zeolite, and to a lesser extent
     pyroxine and olivine. There is an enrichment for sulfur and
     chlorine. The dust is only millimeters thick, so we might be able
     to model the dust like "snow" and have dust storms.

     Beneath the dust is finely broken up basalt, enriched with sulfur
     and chlorine. These deposits are not concentrated enough to mine,
     but it may be that plants could grow in the soil, with some
     nitrate fertilizer, perhaps, and a greenhouse to control the
     temperature and pressure and filter out the radiation.
     More about soil: http://chapters.marssociety.org/winnipeg/soil.html

     The primary type of rock near the surface is basalt (TFC),
     followed by andesite (TFC), which is more common in the northern
     hemisphere. In the lower layers of the crust, andesite dominates,
     intermixed with other igneous rocks like dacite (TFC) and granite (TFC).

     In fluvial landforms (where water was present), near the surface,
     one can find hematite (TFC), kaolinite (TFC), kieserite, jarosite
     (uninteresting), opal (TFC) and gypsum (TFC). Sandstone is also
     present. Maybe limestone (TFC). Also, the Columbia Hills (in Gusev
     Crater) have minerals formed in the presence of water:
     http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbia_Hills_%28Mars%29
       
**** Mineable resources
     Ores:
     * Magma action: Ni-Cu-platinoid clusters, Ti, Fe, Cr
     * Hyrdothermal action: Cu, Zn, Pb, Se, Sb, Cd, As, Ag, Au, Te
     * Soil deposits: basaltic soil might contain chromite (CrO2),
       magnetite (Fe3O8), ilmenite (TiFeO3)
     * Fluvial deposits: Mg + SO4 (kieserite), Ca + SO4 (gypsum),
       hematite blueberries
     * Pegmatite deposits near granite: Li
     
     By platinoid, we mean the elements Pt, Pd, Os, Ir, Ru, Rh (very
     rare). These could be produced as a by-product of processing Ni/Cu,
     or even from nuclear reactors. Mostly used for catalysts
     (especially Pd).

     Ores produced by magma action will commonly occur near the surface
     in the volcanic regions. Otherwise, one needs to dig really
     deep. The hydrothermally concentrated ores will be present
     throughout at moderate depths, and at low depths in impact craters
     and volcanic regions. Soil is uniform throughout, except in the
     fluvial deposits, which have their own surface composition and are
     found in the valleys of the southern hills and impact craters.
     
     Water ice will be a minable resource on Mars (and other cold
     planets). This will be found as ice in the polar regions (perhaps
     covered by a layer of dry ice) and also under the surface. The
     northern lowlands and basins will have ice near the surface, while
     one will need to dig deeper in the southern highlands. Volcanic
     regions are unlikely to have any ice, perhaps a little liquid
     water.

     Also important are geothermal energy sources. This "heat"
     could be modeled similar to lava (as a flow) and some machine
     could be attached to such a heatflow to capture it.
     
**** "Geomes"
     The two hemispheres of Mars are quite different:
     * Northern hemisphere (lower, younger, smoother, 32km crust thickness)
     * Southern hemisphere (higher, older, craters, 58km crust thickness)
     The Northern hemisphere accounts for 1/3 of the surface area. 

     Straddling both is the Tharsis volcanic bulge, which are extremely
     tall volcanoes, with sharp ravines running outward. 7-10 km above
     the surroundings. May account for 25% of the total surface area.

     There are several large, ancient impact basins, surrounded by low
     volcanoes. Deepest point at 8km below "sea level". Full of
     sedimentary material. Possibly 10% of surface. 

     There are large ice caps on both poles. 10%?

     Huge canyons (Valles Marineris), 4000km long, 10km deep. There are
     similar, huge outflow channels, with lots of sediment.

     In summary, we might have the following biomes:
     * Plains (25%) [ocean] [plains]
     * Southern hills (25%) [ocean] [desert hills] [+basins] [+canyons]
     * Volcanic bulge (25%) [minor: hills] [extreme hills] [+canyons]
     * Ice caps (10%) [minor: plains, hills] [ice plains]
     * Impact basins (10%) [generated]
     * Canyons (5%) [generated] [ravine] 
  
     To really communicate the scale of these features, compared to
     Earth and all of its weathering and balanced igneous activity, we
     would probably need to increase the height of the world
     4-5X. Without insane hacking of the code, the true upper limit is
     to increase terrain generation up to 256 (2X). We will defer this
     until we get functioning biomes.

**** Portal
     To be most realistic, we would want the player to construct a
     space ship and lauch to Mars. The amount of resources required for
     such a trip would be generally prohibitive. Therefore, we can rely
     on inspiration from rituals related to Mars/Ares. Ideas:
     * Kill a puppy at night (reflects the sacrifice of puppies). Do we
       want this to be on an altar? Like a 1x3 stone surface, with
       torches. Or any stone?

*** Exoplanets

** Exoplanet Generation
   The main challenge will be creating semi-realistic exoplanets, with
   interesting, playable and challenging combinations of resources and
   conditions.
   
*** High-level Considerations
    Let us begin with purely physical considerations. A planet will have
    a certain:
    * gravity,
    * temperature (orbital zone, albedo, greenhouse effect of atmosphere),
    * weather, like rain (presence/type of atmosphere)
    * length of day (spin rate; could be tidally locked),
    * atmosphere composition (mass, temperature, crust composition),
    * crust composition (raw material, orbital zone, volcanism, water),
    * potential for alien life (temperature, atmosphere, surface liquids)
    
    Here are some simple relationships:
    * Mass depends on radius and density.
    * Orbital zone depends on the type/size of the star, and the
      distance from the star.
    * Albedo depends on the atmosphere and surface; we might just work
      off of the Kepler assumptions.
    * Volcanism depends on the density of the planet.

    We know these values from Kepler:
    * mass
    * gravity
    * orbital zone
    * temperature (need to somehow adjust for atmosphere)
    The other things are more complicated.

*** Crust composition
    Planets are formed from material left over from star formation, so
    the composition of the raw material will be similar to that of the
    star. Since the material must be solid to accrete into a planet, the
    composition also depends on the the orbital zone. There are three
    basic types of material:
    * Metals (Fe, Ni)
    * Silicates (Si)
    * Ices (C, N, O, S)

    We have measurements for C, O, Si, S, Fe, and Ni. Notably, we are
    missing N, so we will need to assume the solar fraction for
    that. All other minor elements not mentioned here will be assumed
    present at solar fractions.

**** Metals
    The metals will be complexed to form:
    * sulfides like FeS (assume 3/4 of S is consumed), 
    * then oxides like FeO, and finally (probably just ignore)
    * carbides (when C dominates O, i.e., where it is very hot).
    
    This is really just important for calculating the amount of
    remaining oxygen.

**** Silicates
    For the silicates, Si will mostly form compounds with Mg, and to a
    much lesser extent with Ca, Al, Na and Ti (in decreasing
    order). These include MgSiO3 and Mg2SiO4. Let us just assume that
    oxygen is consumed at 3X the rate of silicon.

**** Volatiles
    The remaining volatiles will condense in the form of clathrates
    (gas trapped in water crystals), hydrates and pure
    condensates. This depends on two variables: the temperature of the
    disk and whether the environment is oxidizing or reducing. 

    First, for low temperature, in an oxidizing setting, we have:
    * water
    * carbon monoxide (CO)
    * carbon dioxide (CO2)
    * methanol (CH3OH)
    * methane (CH4)
    * nitrogen (N2)
    * ammonia (NH3)
    * hydrogen sulfide (H2S)
    * phosphine (PH3)

    Assume these ratios:
    * CO/CO2/CH3OH/CH4: 70/10/2/1
    * N2/NH3: 10/1
    * H2S/S: 1/2

    In the reducing environment, carbon is only found in methane, and
    we flip the N2/NH3 ratio.

    Oxidation is only possible for C/O < 4/5. Just below the boundary,
    the oxygen is consumed by oxidation, and there is none left for
    water. Reducing conditions occur for any C/O value, so low C/O
    values will be high in water, and even high C/O values will have
    some water.

    At warmer temperatures, solids are converted to gases. CO and N2
    will be the first to convert as temperature increases. It seems
    reasonable to assume that planets initially form in the cold, and
    then as the disk clears up, the temperature increases and the most
    volatile compounds reenter the gas phase. However, this is
    complicated: 
    http://phys.org/news/2012-07-earth.html
    
*** Atmospheric composition
    A planet will capture a tenuous atmosphere prior to formation
    (mostly H and He), but this is likely to change according to
    complex, geophysical processes that are beyond our ability to
    model. Sorry. For interest in the case of Earth, see:
    http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC31109/

    We can say, however, that a planet must have a sufficient mass to
    retain an atmosphere. This is due to gravity, and the extent of the
    magnetosphere. So far, we have not found any exoplanets that small,
    but we can model the thickness of the atmosphere by the mass. 

    It comes down to plate tectonics, major impact events, and complex
    systems. We will assume outgassing is the major player, because
    other events like comet impacts probably are not generally
    significant. Roughly, the bigger the planet, the more geological
    activity and the more outgassing. Usually, the outgassed material
    will be water vapor, nitrogen or carbon-based. In colder regimes,
    ammonia or hydrogen sulfide are possible. Once released, the
    compounds are oxidized by photoreactions (and other things). This
    means that a carbon-based degassing will eventually end up as CO2,
    H2S as SO2, PH3 as PO3, and NH3 as N2. The temperature does not
    necessarily be high enough to maintain the compounds in the gas
    phase, as long as their is replenishment (from life or
    volcanism). The oxidation of methane would lead to heavy
    hydrocarbons that would form seas.

    Once the gases are established, we can model the temperature by the
    amount of greenhouse gases. The more greenhouse gases, the higher
    the temperature (above the Kepler lower limit) and pressure. That
    will help determine the liquid phase elements on the surface, and
    establish a geochemistry. If we determine that biochemistry is
    possible, this will lead to production of other gases.

*** Types of Geochemistry
    In the below, we assume life is carbon-based. We might go after
    silicon-based life later.

**** Water
     This is like the Earth. Requires liquid water on the
     surface. Water cycle produces water vapor in the atmosphere. And
     life would produce oxygen. For simplicity, we assume a planet has
     a single geochemistry.

**** Carbon
     So-called diamond planets. Requires a very low oxygen content, so
     that metals and silicate form carbides. Any oxygen gets tied up
     into CO. Lots of methane, which could form hydrocarbons that rains
     down to produce tar lakes. Life would breathe CO2 (a major
     component of the atmosphere, with CO), and breathe out O2 (minor
     component). Where does all that oxygen come from? Probably
     deposited by impact events, in the same way that Earth got carbon.

**** Sulfur
     Would have sulfuric acid (H2SO4) instead of water. There would be
     trace sulfuric acid vapor in the atmosphere, and life would
     produce O2. Animals would breathe as on Earth. N2 would be the
     other major component. Why would H2SO4 be favored over water?
     There would need to be a lot more sulfur. Would also tend to be
     hotter (around 88 C).

**** Methane
     Would be very cold, around -179 C, so that methane could serve as
     an alternative to water. Life would produce O2 and N2 from trace
     amounts of NO (oxidized from the dominant N2).

**** Phosphorous
     Based on phosphoric acid (H3PO4) instead of water. Atmosphere will
     contain a lot of PO3. The animals would breathe that and exhale
     PH3 and CO2. Would need to be really hot (171 C). And probably a
     lot of initial PH3.

**** Ammonia
     Very cold (-115 C), so any water is frozen and NH3 replaces
     it. Life would produce N2 and O2 from NH3 and CO2. Animals would
     breathe the O2 and exhale CO2, like on Earth.

**** Iron
     Nothing but an iron core. These are probably
     uninteresting. Exclude them?

*** Putting it all together
    Here is an algorithm:
    * Choose an exoplanet with a known mass, radius, distance from sun,
      gravity, and temperature. We assume its star has a known chemical
      composition.
    * Determine a spin rate for length of day. How?
    * Determine the stone/mineral/ore/metal compositions from observed
      Fe, Ni, and Si = Mg amounts, assuming other metals are like Earth.
    * For the volatile C, N, O, S, P, determine amount of volatiles.
      * First decide redox state: C/O > 0.8, reducing, otherwise 50/50.
      * For oxidizing, oxidate C according to ratios.
      * The rest of O becomes water.
    * Estimate the temperature in the protoplanetary disk to determine
      which volatiles were stable enough to condense. For simplicity,
      we assume the planet temperature is the same as its
      embryonic temperature.
    * Simulate outgassing, establish an atmosphere.
    * Simulate any greenhouse effect, increase temperature accordingly.
    * Establish a geochemistry. To keep things interesting, this should
      also include a biochemistry.
    * Regenerate the atmosphere, based on the chemistry.

*** Simple classification
    Because we need to ensure playability, it is not feasible to simply
    randomly assign all of the parameters indepedently. Instead, we
    should have classes of planets (sort of like biomes, although
    planets should have multiple biomes). Within a class, there is a
    small amount of variability.

    The broadest classification would be something like:
    * Gas giant
    * Ice giant (really a gas giant with supercritical water/methane)
    * Terrestrial (rocky)

    Gas giants would be a tough environment, since it would not be
    possbile to survive on the core, if any. In theory, things could be
    made placeable on gas blocks, while the player would still move
    through them. It would be totally trippy though.

    If we chemically classify terrestrial planets, we have:
    * Silicate planets (like Earth and Minecraft), most common (~96%) in galaxy
    * Carbonate planets (diamonds)
    * Iron planets (one big core)
    * Chlorine (rarest)
    * Ammonia
    * Phosphorous
    * Methane (like Titan)
    * Sulfur
    * Water (like Earth)
    * Ocean

    Since the biogeochemistries other than silicate/water are extremely
    rare, we should probably stick to the familiar, especially given our
    educational motivation. 

    The physical classifications are perhaps more relevant:
    * Lava (protoplanets, close orbiting), making up almost 50% of exoplanets
    * Crater (due to lack of atmosphere)
    * Bare rocks (lifeless)
    * Desert
    * Ice
    * Ocean
    * Forest
    * Civilized

    But who really wants to play on planets that are entirely desert, or
    ocean, or lava, or lifeless? Well, there would still be:
    * Interesting crust composition for mining, with possible
      subterranean life. Depending on the planet radius and silicate
      content, the crust can be quite deep.
    * The technical challenges of constructing, configuring and managing
      the colony structure and the robots.
    * The terraforming challenge.

    The surface could be made more interesting by having supply pods
    scattered all over the planet that were dropped during the crash.

* Star travel
*** Goals
    On any planet, the goals are:
    * To survive
    * To build a spaceship and fuel for traveling onward
    * To terraform the world for long term settlement

**** Traveling onward
     This goal solves the end-game problem, where the player has
     solved all challenges. The player is given the opportunity to
     leave the conquered world behind, and to start a-new. However,
     there is some continuity: the player is allowed to stock the ship
     with supplies, and subsamples of that inventory appear as supply
     modules strewn about the new world.

**** Terraforming
     It is not clear how we will model this, or how it would benefit
     the robot player. It would be cool though to have NPC colonies
     appear as the conditions were improved.
     
*** Robotic player
    The idea is to initially model the player as a cyborg. This puts
    less constraints on the player in hostile environments. It also
    opens up interesting possibilities for modular player
    abilities. The robot should be humanoid, for simplicity. We still
    want to model the environment, because one goal is to bring NPCs
    (non-cyborgs) to the world.

**** Component-based abilities
     The player abilities will be based on a component system, which
     replaces the armor system. Instead of having a helmet, breast
     plate, etc, the robotic explorer will have the following component
     slots. There is a basic, built-in component of each type that
     never wears down. The others have a limited life-span.

     It turns out that IC2 already has the battery backpack and solar
     helmet, which behave pretty much as we imagined. The gravitation
     suite addon even extends the batpack to support flight. And
     electric armor is essentially a shield. Really, our only
     contribution will be fuel cells as battery alternatives, plus
     different levels of batteries and solar cells.

     This is also related to the mecha-armor of Factorization.

***** Solar panels
      There will be different levels of solar panels, with increasing
      efficiency and cost. Solar panels yield electrical power, at a
      rate depending on the type of panel and the amount of light. When
      the energy is not being used (i.e., when the player is not moving
      or working), the energy is deposited into the battery.
      
***** Battery
      Better batteries: more storage, slower discharge.
      
***** Fuel cell
      This provides power in addition to the solar panels and is
      necessary for powering heavy duties, like drilling/digging. The
      energy output will depend on the type of fuel. Excess energy is
      deposited into the battery.

      Question: could the fuel cell and battery fill the same slot?
      Batteries should be capable of powering heavy machinery (at
      least the type of machinery a humanoid robot would operate). An
      alternative would be to support only batteries, and fuel cells
      would charge the batteries. It makes sense to generalize: a fuel
      cell and battery are both energy sources; the difference is that
      the battery requires electricity for recharging, whereas a fuel
      cell simply needs to be refilled with fuel.

***** Auxiliary system
      There will be one auxiliary that will consume
      power. Possibilities:
      * Balloon/dirigible
      * Shield (combat, lava diving)
      
**** Respiration
     The cyborg has a built-in air tank that automatically recharges
     when in breathable atmosphere. The tanks will store much more air
     than a single lung's worth, so the constraint is more similar to
     hunger than swimming. The player can carry additional air tanks,
     along with food.
         
**** Environmental Modeling
***** Atmosphere
      Important atmospheric properties are:
       * Temperature (depends on day/night)
       * Pressure
       * Composition

       Possible to do this by having special breathable air blocks that
       change properties when they become adjacent to cold or raw
       atmosphere. This may be too complicated though. Easier to
       use force-fields (via MFFS) and then detect when a player is
       outside of a force-field. Non-cyborgs have a limited amount of
       time before death. This depends on the three properties above,
       but comes out to around 30 seconds maybe for Mars.

       If there are missing life support systems within the
       force-field, the atmosphere will slowly deteriorate (over the
       course of say, one day) and then things start dying. The HUD can
       show the current temperature and composition status (green,
       yellow red; not exact values) for the current dome.
       
***** Radiation
      Planets with thin atmospheres and magnetospheres will not be able
      to block the light from the sun. Depending on the type of star and
      distance, this could mean lethal doses of radiation. Effects of
      this radiation would be long-term, however, so it is tough to
      model. Perhaps it would affect the growth of plants.

**** Life Support
     Machines, mechanical or biological, will be capable of
     conditioning the air. These include:
     * Heater/Cooler (increases/decreases temperature, pressure)
     * Oxygen generation (electrolysis, biomass)

     Both types of oxygen generation require water. The ship will come
     with a finite water source. The occupant will produce water as
     water vapor (exhalation) and as waste (urine, feces). The life
     support system must recover that. Otherwise, it needs to be
     provided externally.

     The obvious advantage of a farm is the consumption of CO2 and the
     production of food, thanks to photosynthesis. The light could come
     from the star, or artificial lighting.

     So, in summary, there are three machines:
     * Heater[Factorization]/cooler
     * Greenhouse: <= free CO2, <= H2O, => O2, => food
     * Water reclaimer [TE Aq Accumulator]: <= free H2O, => captured H2O

     And the "world" inside the habitat converts O2 to CO2 and generates
     free H2O (waste, water vapor).

     Note that we will avoid detailed modeling of this process. if a
     machine breaks, bad things happen. The number of plants needed in
     a greenhouse depends on the population. The better the
     conditions, the more colonists, the more human resources. Note
     that water could be obtained from indigenous sources. This is why
     a heater/cooler is needed: it requires the user to maintain a
     power source.

     Eventually we might add an alternative to the greenhouse:
     * Oxygen generator [IC2 electrolyzer]: <= H2O, => O2
     * CO2 scrubber: <= free CO2, => captured CO2
     
*** Progression
    An important gameplay mechanic is progression through tiers of
    technology/development. Some mods model this using history: how one
    idea led to the next over time. Since we are focused on the
    present, historical progression is not relevant. Instead, we might
    follow the technical complexity gradient: one technology depends on
    having another. The robot is stranded on another world with limited
    supplies, and the lofty goals of either leaving the planet or
    terraforming it.

*** Initiation
    How does one become the robot? This could happen through a long
    string of technological developments, based e.g. on IC2, or we
    could enable early entry.

* Modules
  It seems like these ideas are too numerous to pack into a single,
  monolithic mod. Instead, we could have separate modules:
  * Geologica: rocks and minerals (ores), generated by MOG,
    biome-based regolith and atmospheric composition.
  * Chemica: Provides chemical recipes and machinery, using the
    materials provided by geologica.
  * Fabrica: High-level crafting as a result of chemistry.
  
* Similar mods
** AstroCraft [1.2.5]
   MineCraft floating around in outer space. Gather iron from
   satellites to build tools and fight aliens.

** Solar System Mod [1.2.5]
   Implements all planets in the solar system,
   semi-realisically. Probably the best one out there, and may
   actually be updated for 1.3.2.

** Night Sky + Space Mod [1.2.5]
   Similar to Solar System Craft. Adds some goofy planets. Revives the
   dead Moon and Mars mods.

** SpaceCraft [1.2.5]
   Revives the Moon mod. Interesting poll on forum: people want
   realistic planets, not unrealistic ones.

** TerraFirmaCraft
   This makes survival mode more realistic and challenging. It adds a
   huge number of ores, stones, minerals, metals, gems, and
   trees. These can be very useful for teaching geology and (on some
   planets) biology. We would like to present a similar challenge
   level; however, it is unclear whether such a low level of
   technology (starting with bare hands) would be both interesting and
   an effective means of education. Right now, we are just learning
   from its code, especially with regard to the world
   generation. Handling multiple rock types is a pain.

** Underground Biomes
   This is probably the most similar to geologica: adds 8 types of
   igneous, metamorphic and sedimentary rock, with ores spawning only
   in certain rock types. New types of cobblestone, half slabs,
   etc. Sort of has a different goal though. It wants to make the
   underground more interesting, including underground villages, etc,
   while we just want to add more substances to the game.

** Gasses in Minecraft
   Adds gas sources, transport and processing. About 5-10 gasses are
   supported; apparently there is an API for adding
   more. Unfortunately, does not seem to integrate with BC.
   
** GasCraft
   Not as mature as "Gasses in Minecraft" but integrates with BC.
   
** FrogCraft
   IC2/GT addon that adds industrial chemistry. More similar than
   MineChem, but we want to be more principled/comprehensive and
   independent of GT.   
* Mod Integration
  We define a complex chemical model and programmatically manifest it
  through integration with other mods. Eventually, we might have our
  own system of machines, but for now, our model is sufficiently
  detailed such that any external representation is a reduction of its
  complexity.

  For processing, we can interface at two levels: material and
  recipe. The ore dictionary is the simplest form of material
  integration. It requires that the mod support a particular type of
  material. Gregtech has an enumeration of all materials it handles
  and generates all recipes and items from the material
  definitions. Recipe-level integration requires explicitly specifying
  recipes via an API. Except for Gregtech, this is the primary
  mechanism for mod integration. Below is a table of how abstract
  processing steps map to machines in specific mods:
  
  | Mod           | Communition            |
  |---------------+------------------------|
  | IC2           | Macerator (1)          |
  | Railcraft     | Rock crusher (9,%)     |
  | AE2           | Grinder (2,%)          |
  | TE            | Pulverizer (2,%)       |
  | EnderIO       | SAG Mill (4,%)         |
  | IE            | Crusher (2,%)          |
  | RotaryCraft   | Grinder (1)            |
  | Magneticraft  | Grinder (2,%)          |
  | Mekanism      | Enrichment chamber (1) |
  | BC+           | Duster (1)             |
  | ELN           | ?                      |
  | Hydraulicraft | Crusher (n -- fluid?)  |
  | Metallurgy    | Crusher                |
  | Chemlab       | Centrifugal extractor  |

  The table is roughly in order of prioritization. Of course, GT
  integration takes precedence over the entire table.
  
  Some notes on individual mods:
  
** Gregtech
   We need to work with the maintainer to add new types of
   materials. Once a material is added, we can modify traits, such as
   the composition (including existing materials). These are then
   automatically mapped to machine recipes. For example, pulverizer
   support includes the IC2 macerator, TE pulverizer, and Railcraft
   rock crusher.

** Mekanism
   The enrichment chamber is the closest thing to a pulverizer, even
   though it also acts like a compressor or ore washing plant sometimes.
   
** Chemlab
   A somewhat adhoc mod with interesting machines. The centrifugal
   extractor is closest to dust production, though it depends on
   crushed ore (from the crusher). 
   
** RailCraft
   * Coke oven could be generalized to any type of pyrolysis.
   * Rock crusher should handle ores via ore dictionary.
     
** Forestry
   * Ore dictionary should allow rocks/ores in backpacks.     
     
** IndustrialCraft
   Machines:
   * Grinder :: Macerator
     
** BuildCraft
    The planned distillation tower would be useful, but it seems
    abandoned. Buildcraft Additions adds a multiblock structure, but
    the cooling tower just produces fuel.
    
** Applied Energistics
** Electrical Age
** Rotary/Electri/Reactorcraft
   Series of tech mods based on mechanical, electrical and nuclear
   energy, respectively.
   
** Mekanism
** Binnie's Mods (Genetics, Botany, ExtraBees/Trees)
   The gameplay seems appropriate for any biology we might
   implement. Might be interesting to integrate ideas from CloneCraft
   (dead?) into this.

** WarpDrive
   May be dead, but this lets one build a ship and fly it freely
   through the cosmos.
   
** Witchery
   The most chemical of all of the magic mods. Uses actual chemicals
   in e.g. distillation.
   
** Thermal Expansion
*** Induction furnace
    Could potentially support enhanced reduction. Currently, sand is
    supported for flux; presumably the electric current is the
    reductant. But then this should be called an electric arc
    furnace. An induction furnace is only for melting.
    
*** Pulverizer
    Mapping from strength to MJ cost:
    
    | Strength    |  MJ |
    |-------------+-----|
    | Weak        | 200 |
    | Medium      | 300 |
    | Strong      | 450 |
    | Very Strong | 675 |

** EnderIO
   Provides TE-like facilities for energy storage, item/liquid/power
   transfer, etc.

   Machines:
   * Ore Smelter :: 3 inputs (one more than Induction Smelter), one output.
   * SAG Mill :: Grinder with 4 outputs
     
** Galacticraft
   Obvious base for exploration of other worlds.
   
** Thaumcraft
   We should add magical aspects to every item, so that we mesh with
   magic-based gameplay. The ore dictionary should handle this somehow.
 
** Botania
** PneumaticCraft   
** Hydraulicraft
** Waila
   While we will endeavor to have blocks that rely on rendering rather
   than GUIs, clarity will be limited. Thus, Waila tooltips may help.

* Libraries

** Chemicals
*** Definition
    A GeoMaterial represents something naturally occuring that is
    often extracted for industrial uses. Anyway, a
    GeoMaterial has a specified material and strength, which
    corresponds to a particular hardness and resistance, upon
    manifestation of the substance as a GeoBlock.

    GeoMaterials are currently aggregates and ores. The aggregates and
    have no formalized composition, because it is complex and
    variable. The ores are also technically aggregates; however, they
    are primarily composed of one material, i.e., sphalerite ore
    consists of zinc sulfide, plus impurities. We can therefore claim
    that sphalerite corresponds to /crude/ zinc sulfide. So while not
    all GeoMaterials have a one-to-one relationship with a crude
    material, the ores do. We would include non-stoichiometric
    compounds in the crude category, so even pure olivine is a crude
    material.

    A true chemical would be produced through purification of a crude
    material. For example, zinc sulfide would result from extensive
    processing of sphalerite. While the crude material is obviously
    not equivalent to the pure substance, they are essentially the
    same at some level of abstraction. Thus, there could be a link
    from GeoMaterial to crude material, and from crude material to
    pure chemical.

    Pure chemicals have better defined properties, in particular
    thermodynamic properties. But even chemicals will not have
    available values for all of the states. So we need
    missing/default values. This means that every process will need
    to handle missing values and do something by default, or nothing.

    Obviously chemicals are either elements or compounds. It would
    be easy to determine whether a compound is a sulfide, oxide, etc,
    which are so common in ores. Once we get to organic chemistry, we
    will probably have to resort to adhoc approaches.

*** Phase
    A chemical can exist in any phase: solid, liquid, or gas (we ignore
    the others for now). A chemical /species/ is some physical
    manifestation of the chemical in a particular process. It has a
    definite phase. It is manifested in the game as an ItemStack
    (solid) or FluidStack (liquid/gas). There can be multiple types of
    Item/Fluid for a given chemical. For example, zinc could be a dust
    or an ingot; those would be two different items.

    Most of the properties of a chemical depend on its phase. An
    Item/Fluid will know its phase and provide an accessor for the
    correct properties.
    
*** Formulas
    The atomic stoichiometry is specified by a formula. Depending on
    the type of compound, formulae are written in different ways,
    usually to expose some aspect of their structure. We care about
    some of these aspects. For example, for salts, we want to know the
    cation and anion. For organic molecules, we want to know, e.g. the
    length of the carbon backbone and any (simple) functional
    groups. A Formula object, perhaps derived separately for salts and
    organic molecules, could represent such things. Every chemical
    would have a formula. That formula would refer to the atoms or
    groups of atoms that compose the compound. At the leaves are
    AtomicSymbols corresponding to elements, as well as some special
    cases like electrons and photons.

    How does this work?  Take an example "Na2SO4". This formula
    consists of 2 components: "Na2" and "SO4". Each of those are
    obviously formulae. "Na2" specifies the atomic symbol "Na" and a
    stoichiometry of 2. "SO4" is a molecule that could exist
    separately as an ion. The formula "SO4" refers to child formulae
    "S" and "O4", which are analogous to "Na2".

    What about the elements? Elements are chemicals, and they
    correspond directly to the atomic symbols used in the
    formulas. Elements present at least two problems:
    1. How to define their formula?
    2. The Chemical element and the atomic symbol have the same name,
       which means we cannot import-static into Chemicals for
       convenient syntax. We cannot use straight Chemicals to define a
       formula, because a formula is constructed from formula
       Parts. Unless we explicitly did C._(1). But it is undesirable
       for any Chemical to become a Part (only elements make sense).
    
    Solutions to #1:
    1. Do not define an explicit formula; instead just take the name
       of the enum value, and match it to an AtomicSymbol. A =null=
       Formula could be interpreted this way.
    2. Like #1, but do away with AtomicSymbol and introduce a circular
       reference to the Chemical. Also solves problem #2, but would be
       nice to limit formula parts to atomic symbols.
    
    Solutions to #2:
    1. If we are not allowed to qualify atomic symbols by e.g. "AS"
       or "E", then we need to change the name of the Chemical,
       e.g. "Al" to "Aluminum" or "_Al". That is lame.
    2. Define the elements in a separate enumeration. Also lame.
    3. Merge AtomicSymbol and the Chemical elements, i.e., get rid of
       AtomicSymbol and introduce a new enumeration implementing
       Chemical that defines the elements. Removes that redundancy. It
       also solves Problem #1 by introducing a reference cycle (but a
       cleaner one than any old Chemical). Would have to do ._(1) to
       convert an Element into a Part, or introduce a PartFactory that
       provides a Part (basically the factory would be something
       coercible to a Part). Main downside: another enumeration of
       Chemicals means another set of items, but maybe just the dust?
    
    For convenience, chemicals are listed in a enumeration. This means
    they have a name, and the formula is natural for their name. This
    raises a question: do we derive the formula from the name? Parsing
    might not be too bad, but how to infer salt, vs. something else?
    It starts to smell like a heuristic. Not deriving the formula from
    the name means redundancy; more chances to make an error. The
    problem is that we are dealing with two languages: Java and
    chemistry. We have to /embed/ the chemical language in Java; using
    a Java symbol for a formula does not leverage the Java
    compiler. And for complex cases, it is insufficient; we would need
    to write things another way. So let us just construct formulae in
    a systematic way, and then assign to a Java symbol.
    
    
    We could use some syntactic sugar for declaring
    formulas. For Fe2O3, this might be:
    #+begin_src java
      salt(Fe._(2), O._(3))
      salt(Li._(2), mol(S, O._(4)))
    #+end_src
    And then a reaction:
    #+begin_src java
    LiSO4.plus(NaCO3).yields(LiCO3).plus(Na2SO4)
    #+end_src
    With stoichiometry:
    #+begin_src java
    Li2CO3.plus(2, HCl).yields(2, LiCl).plus(CO2).plus(H2O)
    #+end_src
    With phases:
    #+begin_src java
    term(Li2CO3, s).plus(2, HCl, aq).yields(2, LiCl, s).plus(CO2).plus(H2O)
    #+end_src

    When we specify "aq" as the state, what does it mean? What we are
    really saying is that we have liquid water with dissolved
    HCl. And in fact it is somewhat under-specified. We want to model
    solutions as either dilute or concentrated. So we want something
    like:
    #+begin_src java
    Li2CO3.plus(2, dilute(HCl)).yields(2, LiCl).plus(CO2).plus(H2O)
    #+end_src
    The =dilute= (or =concentrated=) methods will return a new
    chemical in the liquid state. That is a lot cleaner than
    borrowing the (aq) convenience from hand-written formulae.

    Adjust a formula. Let us consider the use case of replacing "S"
    with "O" when roasting a sulfide. We want to do something like:
    #+begin_src java
    formula.replace(S, O);
    #+end_src
    Which is just shorthand for:
    #+begin_src java
    formula.replace(S._(1), O._(1));
    #+end_src
    But it seems like we want the formula to be immutable, i.e., the
    =replace= method should return a modified copy. Creating an
    immutable object in Java is tricky, especially with inheritance.
    
*** Fluids
    We will have a fluid for every gas and every liquid. There is no
    limit on the number of fluids, and we can use item damage for
    liquid containers (just need two items, one filled, one
    empty). The problem is the fluid blocks. To have these chemicals
    in the world, we will probably need to rely on NBT tags. This
    means that we can only have a limited number of such blocks in the
    world. Since we are not generating these in the world, this should
    be OK. It would be neat to have liquid and gas blocks for
    every chemical, with pumps and fans moving them around. Not just
    in pipes. NBT here we come on that one.
    
** Processing of crude materials
   
   Here are some simple rules for ore processing:
   * Grinding an ore yields a dust of a crude material.
   * Smelting the ore block or the result of grinding
     the ore block should yield the same product, like an ingot.
   * Sulfide ores are roasted to oxides.
   * Hydroxides and carbonates are calcined to oxides.
   * Smelting reduces oxides to the metal.

   Let's review an example: generalized sulfide ore roasting. The
   recipe registration mechanism (think of it as a recipe compiler)
   loops over the pure materials. When it finds a sulfide, it knows
   that roasting (smelting) it will convert the sulfide to an
   oxide. It finds the corresponding oxide (replaces the S with O in
   the formula and looks up the corresponding chemical) and registers
   the recipe. The recipe should apply to both the sulfide chemical
   and the ore/mineral. That could use the ore dictionary or a more
   formal relationship between the ore and the chemical. If there is a
   vent attached to the furnace, it will detect (hopefully) when a
   sulfide ore is smelted and emit SO2.

   Another example: processing of limonite into iron. Limonite is an
   ore that consists of a mixture of iron hydroxides. Assume it is
   mostly goethite, FeO(OH). Then, we need to calculate a calcining
   temperature. There is no exact value, due to impurities, different
   levels of hydration, etc, so we could specify a rough temperature,
   similar to the rock hardness. If the calculations are rough,
   perhaps we could derive the temperatures from a rough notion of the
   "reactivity" of the metal. Or we could just use
   thermodynamics. This is a bit tricky at low temperatures, where
   thermodynamics predicts a temperature below the boiling point of
   water, so it needs adjustment.

   A complication: Ni can be incorporated into goethite (substituting
   for iron). This is true of many minerals, i.e., while a mineral is
   not really a mixture, there is non-stoichiometry. The question is
   whether to consider laterites as goethite (instead of limonite)
   and model goethite as a crude, non-stoichiometric substance, i.e.,
   not a mixture. The alternative is to say that limonite is a
   mixture of FeO(OH) and NiO. Another alternative: say that limonite
   is primarily (an ore of) FeO(OH), but have a recipe/reaction that
   extracts NiSO4 after treatment with H2SO4 at a specified
   temperature. We need that reaction anyway, so that sounds reasonable.

   Is an ore a mixture? Of course, it's a special mixture with one
   component being the "concentrate", but how to differentiate it from
   plain old rocks and soil, i.e., aggregates? Have an Aggregate
   interface, and a SimpleAggregate implementation. Those would
   correspond to Ore and SimpleOre.

   Or what about simply having separate enumerations? One for rocks,
   one for ores. GeoBlock could still operate over both of them (they
   would both implement GeoMaterial). Downside: need to reimplement
   everything. So we either reimplement GeoMaterial or implement the
   Ore/Aggregate classes. The main objection to having multiple enums
   is that it seems arbitrary to separate ores and rocks -- where
   does the laterite clay go? The composition is a natural parameter
   of the material.
   
** Reactions
   A reaction is a type of recipe with reactants and products with
   molar coefficients and states. There are multiple layers of
   abstraction, best worked out by the process. When a machine
   receives input items, it needs to map them (by name?) to a
   recipe. This is a special recipe that has a dynamic reaction model
   that is controlled and viewed by the machine interface. It yields
   one or more items as products. This low-level recipe needs to be
   registered and constructed by some factory. If we have a set of
   well-described chemicals, the reaction parameters should be
   determinable from the substances alone. We declare a "reaction" in
   terms of substances, and that is translated to one or more
   recipes. If we have crude materials without well-defined
   properties, we could either make up the properties or specify
   parameters at the reaction level (easier?). There, we declare an
   "ore operation" in terms of crude substances and chemicals, and
   that is translated to some recipes. So there are two layers: the
   abstract, process-level description, and the low-level recipes. One
   abstract process might correspond to multiple recipes (manual,
   machine, etc).

   For the crude processes, we could have a CrudeReaction class, with
   crudes and chemicals, and reaction-level parameters. A bunch of
   CrudeReaction instances are registered, and a factory iterates over
   them, converting them to reaction recipes.

   How does the reaction => recipe mapping occur? Some factory needs
   to perform two steps:
   1. Map the materials to item(stack)s.
   2. Generate a fully parameterized reaction model.
      
   There might not be a need to actually have a Reation
   object. Instead, there is a method call with a signature that
   depends on the mode of reaction recipe construction. For crude
   materials, the materials and model parameters should be
   specified. For the pure chemical reactions, those parameters can be
   derived from the chemicals. This would be a Registrant object that
   would store recipes in a Registry object. It is given the registry,
   a ReactionTermToItemStack factory, and a ReactionModelFactory (to
   be used if the model is not given explicitly).

** Block Construction
   When creating a GeoBlock from a material, we need to decide who
   implements the construction. Currently, this is a mix between a
   static factory method in GeologicaBlocks, and the subclass
   constructors. Somehow, we should either put most everything inside
   the constructors or put everything in some sort of factory.

   Here are the steps:
   * (factory) ID allocation/assignment, name
   * (constructor) material, creative tab, step sound 
   * (constructor) meta blocks
   * (constructor) hardness and resistance

   Is this a natural split? The ID allocation should happen
   up-front. The name then obviously needs to be set by the factory
   (probably via setter). The material is tied to the subclass
   (inheritance is used only to define the items dropped). If we know
   the material, then we know the step sound. The creative tab is
   always known to be a block.

   The hardness/resistance are tied to the strength, and the meta
   blocks are tied to the material and strength.  By putting the meta
   blocks, hardness/resistance and material into the same, low-level
   constructor, we ensure that all the values are consistent in terms
   of the strength. But we could make the block completely agnostic of
   strength: it would just take the given meta blocks and
   hardness/resistance, etc. If we then passed the texture file as a
   parameter, we could get rid of the intact/broken subclasses. But
   making the blocks agnostic of strength would be tricky, since they
   are given GeoMaterial objects, which have a strength. Is there a
   reason to demand such flexibility? Do we really need multiple
   strategies for finding meta blocks given a strength?

** GeoMaterial as an Enum
   The GeoMaterial would be convenient as an enum, as long as we do
   not expect substances to come from some other source. The
   convenience comes from both the syntax and automatic registration
   (via reflection). Other mods could add substances, for example. If
   that happened, there would need to be a configuration system to
   prevent ID conflicts. Why would they want to add new substances?
   Probably to take advantage of the chemical modeling. Since IDs are
   only necessary for meta/damage values, we could introduce an
   independent object, maybe Chemical, that would simply define a
   set of chemical properties. It is not yet clear whether we will
   have a sophisticated chemical model or if we will just add recipes
   for particular chemicals. If the latter, there may be no benefit
   to adding new substances. They would just be an internal utility
   for book-keeping of the meta blocks and items. Since those
   substances do not have any behaviors, it probably will not be
   necessary to extend them. They are simple tuples of data.

** Substances and blocks, etc
   We want to represent substances in the world. For now, let us
   limit the discussion to geological substances: rocks and
   minerals. A substance can assume many forms. In the world, it is
   as an intact block. If the block is broken, it yields a broken
   form. The granularity of the broken form depends on the intact
   strength. So weak stone becomes gravel, strong stone becomes
   cobblestone and very strong stone remains intact. 

   An intact block for a substance is more or less defined by the
   following properties:
   * Material/stepSound (from material)
   * Hardness/resistance (from strength)
   * Drop strategy (subclass)
   
   Currently, we use the substance material to do two things: derive
   the material of the block and select substances for a particular
   drop strategy (block subclass). This is a problem, because both
   rocks and minerals can be of the "rock" material, but minerals have
   a different drop strategy. And direct-drop substances could be
   rocks, sands, or maybe even dirt or clay. This substance/material
   type could be a parameter of the substance, or we could imply it by
   keeping the substances in separate lists. Separate lists would
   probably mean separate enums, all of which implement some
   GeoMaterial interface. The separate enums could each have unique
   qualities. For example, a mineral could reference a chemical. If we
   did not go the separate list/enum route, every substance would have
   a chemical field, with non-minerals using a null value. The pain of
   separate enums is that we would need to reimplement substance for
   each type. The implementation is not complicated, but it is extra
   effort. Anyway, it is clear that the material and harvest strategy
   are two different parameters.

   So if wanted to parameterize the drop/harvest strategy, what are
   the possibilities?
   * a single, broken block (stone)
   * multiple pieces (coal, redstone, clay)
   * self drop (ores, sandstone)
   
   Claystone could follow the sandstone example, which essentially
   exists in a broken/cobble state. Then a machine like a pulverizer
   could convert claystone to clay (as it does sandstone to sand). So
   at this point, we will support the single-broken (stone) and
   self-drop strategies (minerals).

   There are then three parameters:
   * Strength: weak, medium, strong, very strong
   * Harvest: self (default), broken, pieces
   * Material: rock (default), sand
     
   The next debate is whether to add parameters for e.g. the chemical
   which would be yielded upon pulverizing or smelting a mineral. One
   issue is that it might become untenable to specify recipes through
   substance properties. There are so many machines, with so many
   recipes. Might be simplest to consider the recipes orthogonal. One
   might try to make the case that we need chemicals in order to add
   the chemical formula to e.g. a tooltip, or something. But this is
   not so important.

   We could translate the harvest style to a "type" of substance:
   * Rock: broken (cobblestone)
   * Ore: self
   * Crystal: pieces
   This makes a lot of sense. Rocks and ores should be a single
   block; no reason to have individual pieces. And ore does not
   matter whether it is broken or intact. Crystals though are easily
   obtained during mining. There is some question as to whether these
   represent all types of geological substances. If we wanted to
   support an arbitrary set, we would probably want to use
   polymorphism instead of a parameter.
   
** Textures
   If we use the substance IDs as indexes into the sprite maps, we
   will need a separate map for every manifestation of the
   substance. There will be several manifestations: intact (rocks and
   minerals in native form, metal ingots), broken (cobblestone,
   pulverized minerals, metal nuggets), and processed (bricks for
   stone, blocks of metal). As long as we are limited to these three,
   it makes sense to use a separate file for each. May need a fourth
   for arbitrary textures.
   
** Processes
   Once we have a material, we need to do something with it. That
   something is a process. A process turns one material, in a specific
   state, into one or more other materials, in a specific state. The
   set of processes can be modeled as a bipartite graph, with a set of
   nodes representing the materials (in some particular state) and a
   set of nodes representing the processes. Edges, at least from a
   process to a material, can be weighted. The material nodes are
   very close to being actual blocks and items, because they are in
   some state, like a dust or ore block. The question becomes whether
   it is worth abstracting the process graph or if low-level
   representation as recipes is sufficient.

   We are currently representing processes as recipes, and it has
   become apparent that some abtraction might be useful, even if not
   at the level of the process graph. For example, a GeoMaterial has
   some composition, and and grinding will always output its primary
   componen as a dust. Both the dust and the original ore block can
   perhaps be smelted to a metal ingot. The point is that there is
   some equivalency through composition. This equivalency is very
   much related to the purpose of the ore dictionary. The ore
   dictionary is a fairly rudimentary abstraction, but it works, and
   is something we need anyway.
  
** Multiblocks
   Multiblock structures are essentially crafting but with blocks in
   the world (and thus in 3D). The basic design pattern is that a
   particular arrangement of blocks is somehow detected, and then a
   tile entity is established at some position within the
   structure. The tile entity represents the machine. If the
   arrangement is disturbed, the machine is disabled, and the tile
   entity might even be deleted.

   The central challenge is detecting the arrangement of blocks and
   responding to any changes. Strategies include:
   * Blocks responding to their onNeighborBlockChanged() signal, which
     can only detect adjacent changes,
   * Blocks checking on a timer for whether the structure is satisfied
   * Checking the arrangement when the player uses a tool, like a
     wrench or magic wand.
     
   The last approach, tool activation, has the advantage of engaging
   the player --- the machine does not convert "magically", the player
   has to take some action. But tool activation does not detect
   later disturbances to the structure.

   One solution is to check structural integrity with each
   "operation". This brings up the question: how is a multiblock
   structure different from a particular combination of individual
   blocks that function together for some purpose? Would such a
   "federation" of blocks be able to model a single machine?

   Consider the blast furnace as an example. A minecart with chest
   runs over the hopper, which transfers the coke, limestone and ore
   to a dropper, which drops the items. If the items land on a tuyere
   block, the coke is consumed to produce fire. If the tuyere block
   has air to dispense, it does, and the combustion is accelerated
   (coke is consumed at a higher rate). That fire block is actually a
   flue gas source block (it is just rendered as fire). The gas will
   spread through the rest of the furnace, and a vent at the top will
   capture it. If there is no vent, then the vessel will fill with
   gas/fire and eventually explode. Fire blocks will slowly spread
   (converting gas blocks to fire/source blocks), except there is
   always a layer of gas at the top, against the ceiling.  The energy
   of the coke is used to heat the air, flux and ore. Eventually the
   temperature is sufficient to produce slag and molten iron by
   converting the limestone and ore below the fire (on the bottom
   layer). The temperature model is such that if there is an opening
   in the furnace, or if there is no air blast (the hotter the
   better), temperature will never be high enough to produce iron. A
   finite iron/slag mixture fluid accumulates on the bottom (this will
   displace the fire block). A drain block then captures the molten
   product. Since the iron is denser than the slag, a drain on the
   bottom will emit iron first, while drains on the side emit the
   mixture. Interesting.
